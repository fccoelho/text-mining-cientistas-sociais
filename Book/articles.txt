This article explores the question of why the nine pandemics prior to COVID which have affected millions of people since the second half of the th century were not recorded in collective memory despite their magnitude and extent Thus it proposes a reading of the pandemic as one component of a wider syndemic made up of contagious diseases climate change and malnutrition This piece offers a narrative of the origins development and prospects of the pandemic within the dynamics of the global food system and national economic and political systems highlighting components and connections It includes a warning that along with climate change and malnutrition undernourishment obesity pandemics are known and expected outcomes of the workings of a socio political system that as in the case of other components of the syndemic by naturalizing causes and individualizing consequences conspire against the creation of narratives that go beyond cosmetic changes
The decline in vaccination coverage associated with the population s mistrust of vaccines has been defined as a global health threat Adopting a qualitative approach centered on the social significance of vaccines we conducted semi structured interviews with mothers and fathers in the City of Buenos Aires between July and December We describe and analyze their knowledge and the arguments used to justify their acceptance or reluctance to vaccinate their children in the context of COVID The results show that the studied population possesses knowledge about vaccines and accepts them as a preventive practice Nonetheless it was possible to identify a broad spectrum of attitudes towards vaccination including more reticent positions based on concerns regarding their safety adverse effects and the need to apply them for eradicated diseases proposing vaccination as an optional and complementary practice to other care practices Arguments are organized under the assumption of individual and moral responsibility for health care an expression of the current sociocultural and health backdrop
This article summarizes the strategies used to rapidly develop COVID vaccines and distribute them globally with an emphasis on vaccines developed in western nations It is based on interviews and information gathered regarding the response to the pandemic both from international organizations and official documents from Brazil Argentina Colombia Peru and Mexico While vaccine development has been hailed as successful their global distribution has been highly unequal We look at how the pandemic succeeded in mobilizing large quantities of government resources and how citizens volunteered their bodies so that clinical trials could be completed quickly However patents prevented the expansion of manufacturing capacity and the governments of a few wealthy countries prioritized the protection and in some cases overprotection of their citizens at the expense of protecting the rest of world s population Among the major beneficiaries of the global response to the pandemic are the leading vaccine companies their executives and investors The article concludes with some of the lessons learned in this process

The COVID pandemic created an environment of disruption and adversity for many adolescents We sought to establish the prevalence of non dating sexual violence sexual dating violence and physical dating violence victimization among adolescents during the COVID pandemic and to investigate whether experiences of disruption and adversity placed adolescents at greater risk for these forms of interpersonal violence We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Adolescent Behavior and Experiences Survey collected January to June from a nationally representative sample of U S high school students i N i Exposures included abuse by a parent economic housing and food and nutrition insecurity interpersonal connectedness and personal well being Among female students experienced non dating sexual violence experienced sexual dating violence and experienced physical dating violence Among male students experienced non dating sexual violence experienced sexual dating violence and experienced physical dating violence Among female students both emotional and physical abuse by a parent was related to non dating sexual violence emotional abuse was related to sexual dating violence and physical abuse was related to physical dating violence Among males emotional abuse by a parent was related to physical dating violence and physical abuse by a parent was related to sexual dating violence Hunger was associated with sexual and physical dating violence among female students and homeless was associated with physical dating violence among male students Although there were differences by sex abuse by a parent hunger and homelessness created precarity that may have increased the likelihood that adolescents would be exposed to risky peer or dating relationships Adolescents need support that stops and prevents experiences of non dating sexual and dating violence connected to interventions that address adversities experienced during the COVID pandemic
This preregistered study examined how face masks influenced face memory in a North American sample of to month old infants N born during the COVID pandemic Infants memory was tested using a standard visual paired comparison VPC task We crossed whether or not the faces were masked during familiarization and test yielding four trial types masked familiarization masked test unmasked familiarization masked test masked familiarization unmasked test and unmasked familiarization unmasked test Infants showed memory for the faces if the faces were unmasked at test regardless of whether or not the face was masked during familiarization However infants did not show robust evidence of memory when test faces were masked regardless of the familiarization condition In addition infants bias for looking at the upper eye region was greater for masked than unmasked faces although this difference was unrelated to memory performance In summary although the presence of face masks does appear to influence infants processing of and memory for faces they can form memories of masked faces and recognize those familiar faces even when unmasked
To control the ongoing COVID pandemic a variety of SARS CoV vaccines have been developed However the rapid mutations of SARS CoV spike S protein may reduce the protective efficacy of the existing vaccines which is mainly determined by the level of neutralizing antibodies targeting S In this study we screened prevalent S mutations and constructed pseudotyped lentiviral particles carrying these mutants We challenged these pseudoviruses with sera vaccinated by Sinovac CoronaVac and ZF vaccines two popular vaccines designed for the initial strain of SARS CoV and then systematically assessed the susceptivity of these SARS CoV variants to the immune sera of vaccines As a result S mutants H Y V I S N V L K R L F S N L M F L F L Y H P R A S S N S L A V S N T I E Q were found to be significantly resistant to neutralization indicating reduced protective efficacy of the vaccines against these SARS CoV variants In addition F L and Y H significantly enhanced the utilization of human ACE suggesting a potentially elevated infectivity of these two mutants In conclusion our results show that some prevalent S mutations of SARS CoV reduced the protective efficacy of current vaccines and enhance the infectivity of the virus indicating the necessity of vaccine renewal and providing direction for the development of new vaccines This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved
An outbreak of COVID was reported in Yongchuan district of Chongqing China in March while the source was unknown We aimed to investigate the origin and transmission route of the virus in the outbreak We conducted field investigations for all cases and collected their epidemiological and clinical data We performed gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis for the cases and draw the epidemic curve and the case relationship chart to analyze interactions and possible transmission mode of the outbreak A total of cases of COVID including patients and asymptomatic cases were laboratory confirmed in the outbreak The branch of the virus was Omicron BA which was introduced into Yongchuan district by a traveler in early March Patient F and asymptomatic case G had never contact with other positive infected individuals but close contact with their pet dog that sniffed the discarded cigarette butts and stepped on the sputum of patient B Laboratory test results showed that the dog hair and kennel were positive for SARS CoV and the ten isolates were highly homologous to an epidemic strain in a province of China The investigation suggested that the contaminated dog by SARS CoV can act as a passive mechanical carrier of the virus and might transmit the virus to humans through close contact Our findings suggest that during the COVID pandemic increasing hygiene measures and hand washing after close contact with pets is essential to minimize the risk of community spread of the virus This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved

In this article we argue that the government s post torture program was a big lie in that the designers executors and enablers knew all along that torture does not elicit reliable information We review the government s own research on the matter and we discuss the ways in which methods known to be unreliable were implemented most saliently at the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay We review the secrecy and propaganda surrounding the scope and horror of the torture program at Guantánamo and black sites around the world and the painful truth of how the government knowingly adopted the terror policies of the torture program against their own knowledge against international human rights and against the law On January Joseph R Biden Jr became the th President of the United States following what might very well have been the most chaotic election in the recent history of the United States The turmoil reached a peak on Jan when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington DC At the center of this extended and ongoing political upheaval is what has been labeled The Big Lie the completely disproven notion that Biden s win was based on fraudulent grounds and that the election was stolen from Trump because of a corrupted voting process President Biden has consistently rejected reality warping and presents himself on the national stage as a man of reason and a strong supporter of science He has proclaimed Science is discovery It s not fiction as he announced that his team of scientific advisors would summon science and truth to combat climate change the COVID pandemic and other challenges facing his new administration adding The same laws apply the same evidence holds true regardless of whether you accept them President Biden can show his self proclaimed commitment to truth by following through on his words with action In particular he can fulfil the task which his two predecessors Trump and Obama both failed to do Closing the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay The same United States law and international law apply the same evidence or lack thereof holds true for those remaining prisoners being held within the confines of a US run concentration camp in the Caribbean The laws of science apply the rules of evidence apply and the rule of law applies Science and truth cannot be situationally applied to suit political agendas especially not within the confines of a facility once called a Battle Lab Leopold where the military touts phrases like honor bound and defend freedom at the entrance yet the truths of what goes on inside are withheld from the public record via the government s complex layers of secrecy including classification redactions and obfuscations There can be no justice without truth The system has derailed every effort to bring the suspected terrorists to justice before tribunals that have failed and have been derailed by torture While President Biden can t remove the stain of the national torture policies he can show that the Constitution endures that the rule of law prevails by illuminating the shadowland of the torture regime Joe Biden needs to demonstrate that truth matters even painful truths In this article we will describe that through a painstaking and laborious process of discovery we now know that behind the gates of Guantánamo Bay and its related archipelago of black sites there were prisoners often held on dubious grounds or no reasonable grounds at all We know that these prisoners were submitted to treatments aimed squarely at generating complete psychological disintegration As we will lay out in the article prisoners captured during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom were subjected to physical violence sexual violence and an astonishing array of psychologically abusive tactics under the misnomer interrogation We also know that the torture program metastasized into a monster as if lifted from the pages of the most absurd of postmodern fictions and that the United States has never held anyone accountable nor faced any reckoning for this disaster of human rights Senate Select Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency Detention and Interrogation Program And we know that the disaster that was the torture program was all based on lies one big lie in particular that torture worked to break through to truth The chief argument which we will defend below is that the schemers behind the system of torture knew all along that this was bogus that torture does nothing to produce truth that what it breaks is a person s autonomy and very selfhood rendering them compliant in the extreme Indeed the CIA and United States military who both committed war crimes knew all along that they propagated falsehoods our main argument is that the historical record shows that the CIA itself has a long history of studying precisely the effect of techniques like those employed post As we shall see the so called architects had no interrogation experience but were well versed in communist based methodologies known to produce false information
b Background b We compared the pattern of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi females of all ages between months preceding the coronavirus disease COVID pandemic and the same months year later within the COVID pandemic b Methods b This was a cross sectional study that targeted all female patients attending an outpatient clinic for dermatology and venereology in Al Kindy teaching hospital Baghdad between October to the end of January and the same month duration year later October to the end of January after the COVID peak period had passed and there was no or partial curfew to exclude seasonal impact b Results b A total of female patients of all ages were enrolled in this study with females during the months pre COVID and females during the pandemic The mean age of patients presented before the pandemic was years while the mean age of patients during the pandemic was years with no statistically significant difference in mean ages P Hair loss in general with telogen effluvium specifically increased significantly Cutaneous contagious viral infections were reduced significantly and specifically of these molluscum contagiosum and condylomata accuminata Other forms of infections including bacterial and parasitic were also reduced while dermatophytosis was increased but not to a significant level Acne vulgaris rosacea lichen planus urticaria pityriasis rosea seborrheic dermatitis and vitiligo were increased but psoriasis alopecia areata other types of dermatitis and melasma were reduced but none to a significant level b Conclusions b The COVID pandemic resulted in changes in the pattern of diseases presented to an out patient clinic for dermatology and venereology This could be either related to COVID infection or stress associated with the pandemic because of curfew or wearing facemasks which may cause a decrease or increase in certain diseases

Multiple vaccines have been developed and licensed for SARS CoV While these vaccines reduce disease severity they do not prevent infection and SARS CoV continues to spread and evolve To prevent infection and limit transmission vaccines must be developed that induce immunity in the respiratory tract Therefore we performed proof of principle vaccination studies with an intranasal nanoparticle vaccine against SARS CoV The vaccine candidate consisted of the self assembling subunit I protein scaffold covalently decorated with the SARS CoV receptor binding domain RBD using the SpyCatcher SpyTag system We verified the intended antigen display features by reconstructing the I scaffold to A using cryo EM and then demonstrated that the scaffold was highly saturated when grafted with RBD Using this RBD grafted SpyCage scaffold RBD SpyCage we performed two unadjuvanted intranasal vaccination studies in the gold standard preclinical Syrian hamster model Hamsters received two vaccinations days apart and were then challenged days post boost with SARS CoV The initial study focused on assessing the immunogenicity of RBD SpyCage which indicated that vaccination of hamsters induced a non neutralizing antibody response that enhanced viral clearance but did not prevent infection In an expanded study we demonstrated that covalent bonding of RBD to the scaffold was required to induce an antibody response Consistent with the initial study animals vaccinated with RBD SpyCage more rapidly cleared SARS CoV from both the upper and lower respiratory tract These findings demonstrate the intranasal SpyCage vaccine platform can induce protection against SARS CoV and with additional modifications to improve immunogenicity is a versatile platform for the development of intranasal vaccines targeting respiratory pathogens
The first step in SARS CoV genomic surveillance is testing to identify infected people However global testing rates are falling as we emerge from the acute health emergency and remain low in many low and middle income countries LMICs mean tests people day We simulated COVID epidemics in a prototypical LMIC to investigate how testing rates sampling strategies and sequencing proportions jointly impact surveillance outcomes and showed that low testing rates and spatiotemporal biases delay time to detection of new variants by weeks to months and can lead to unreliable estimates of variant prevalence even when the proportion of samples sequenced is increased Accordingly investments in wider access to diagnostics to support testing rates of âˆ¼ tests people day could enable more timely detection of new variants and reliable estimates of variant prevalence The performance of global SARS CoV genomic surveillance programs is fundamentally limited by access to diagnostic testing

One year after the outbreak of COVID medical staff are facing high anxiety due to multiple work stresses Social support has become a protective factor for healthcare workers anxiety symptoms but the exact mechanism of action is not yet known Based on the buffering model this study aims to explore the impact and mechanisms of action of healthcare workers perception of social support PSS on anxiety symptoms in the context of the epidemic and to further explore how the emotional characteristics of risk perception ECRP and resilience play their influence To this end this study measured healthcare workers using an online questionnaire from February to March The results found that PSS among healthcare workers negatively predicted anxiety symptoms ECRP partially mediated the relationship between PSS and anxiety symptoms and resilience moderated the first half of the pathway in the model of PSS through ECRP on anxiety symptoms The emotional characteristics of risk perception of COVID in individuals with high resilience decrease significantly with the increase of PSS while this change is not significant in individuals with low resilience
The World Health Organization has a mandate to compile and disseminate statistics on mortality and we have been tracking the progression of the COVID pandemic since the beginning of sup sup Reported statistics on COVID mortality are problematic for many countries owing to variations in testing access differential diagnostic capacity and inconsistent certification of COVID as cause of death Beyond what is directly attributable to it the pandemic has caused extensive collateral damage that has led to losses of lives and livelihoods Here we report a comprehensive and consistent measurement of the impact of the COVID pandemic by estimating excess deaths by month for and We predict the pandemic period all cause deaths in locations lacking complete reported data using an overdispersed Poisson count framework that applies Bayesian inference techniques to quantify uncertainty We estimate million excess deaths globally times more deaths than the million reported as due to COVID for the period There are wide variations in the excess death estimates across the six World Health Organization regions We describe the data and methods used to generate these estimates and highlight the need for better reporting where gaps persist We discuss various summary measures and the hazards of ranking countries epidemic responses
Timing of endotracheal intubation in COVID patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS remains controversial regarding its risk and benefit in patient outcomes Our study aims to elucidate early versus late intubation outcomes among COVID patients with ARDS A protocol of this study is registered at the international prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO CRD We report our systematic review based on PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines We searched the Cochrane Library EBSCOhost EMBASE Grey Literature Report OpenGrey ProQuest PubMed and ScienceDirect from inception until December Titles and abstracts were reviewed for their relevance The risk of bias in each study was evaluated using the risk of bias in non randomised studies of interventions ROBINS I guideline Trial sequential analysis is done to elucidate firm evidence We retrieved observational studies that assessed an intervention early vs late intubation Meta analysis for in hospital mortality reduction showed fewer deaths per patients in early intubation Early intubation reduces days of ICU length of stay LOS and days of ventilation duration Benefits for mortality and ICU LOS reduction were based on studies with low to moderate risk of bias while ventilation duration was based on low disease burden setting According to the contextualized approach the benefit of mortality reduction showed a trivial effect while ICU LOS and ventilation duration showed a small effect GRADE certainty of evidence for mortality reduction in early intubation is moderate The certainty of evidence for ICU length of stay ventilation duration ventilator free days and continuous renal replacement therapy are very low This updated systematic review provided new evidence that early intubation might provide benefits in treating COVID patients with ARDS The benefits of early intubation appear to have an important but small effect based on contextualized approach for ICU LOS and ventilation duration In reducing in hospital mortality the early intubation effect was present but only trivial based on contextualized approach TSA showed that more studies are needed to elucidate firmer evidence
This study investigated the factors affecting adolescents well being during the COVID pandemic from the perspectives of their participation in digital activities emotional regulation self regulated learning and parental involvement Using self reported data from pairs of adolescents and their parents we performed multiple group structural equation modeling which revealed that self efficacy in online learning during school suspension was a key factor influencing adolescents perceived worries after schools resumed During school suspension boys cognitive emotional regulation played a protective role in their well being helping them to avoid cyberbullying incidents while girls participation in leisure oriented digital activities compromised their self efficacy in online learning and led to cyberbullying incidents Furthermore improvement in parent child relationships during school suspension encouraged adolescents to use more positive emotional regulation strategies enhanced their self efficacy in online learning and reduced their leisure time digital activities The findings indicate that the effective regulation of adolescents online behaviors emotions and self efficacy especially when combined with an emotionally secure family relationship can ensure adolescents well being
COVID poses a significant burden to populations worldwide Although the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation little is known about the influence of digitalization on pandemic developments Therefore this country level study aims to explore the impact of pre pandemic digital adoption on COVID outcomes and government measures Using the Digital Adoption Index DAI we examined the association between countries digital preparedness levels and COVID cases deaths and stringency indices SI of government measures until March Gradient Tree Boosting based algorithm pinpointed essential features related to COVID trends such as digital adoption populations smoker fraction age and poverty Subsequently regression analyses indicated that higher DAI was associated with significant declines in new cases β pm p and attributed deaths β pm p months after the peak When plotting DAI against the SI normalized for the starting day countries with higher DAI adopted slightly more stringent government measures β p Finally a scoping review identified publications providing valuable arguments for our findings Countries with higher DAI before the pandemic show a positive trend in handling the pandemic and facilitate the implementation of more decisive governmental measures Further distribution of digital adoption may have the potential to attenuate the impact of COVID cases and deaths

While the global population continues to rise the total fertility rate in many high income countries is below replacement a trend apparent over several decades The timing and pace of this change will shape the age distribution in these countries leading to an increasing proportion of older people The well established links of the demographic transition between improving female education and improved access to contraception continue to drive down fertility rates in low middle income countries However changes in the age distribution will not be as marked as in high income countries in the coming decades These relationships may now be changing in some high income countries with greater prosperity at both the personal level in some sectors of society and the national level linked to an increase in total fertility rates despite continuing trends towards older age at first birth Key drivers in these countries include improved provision of free low cost child care paid parental leave and higher paternal contributions to child care However there is also a rise in the number of women who do not have children or who may be unable to complete their family plans COVID and environmental factors including the rising prevalence of obesity add to pressures on fertility rates Variable knowledge of the realities of female reproductive ageing particularly by men is also a contributing factor and this complex mix has also fuelled the increase in elective egg freezing

The COVID pandemic restrictions uncertainties and management inconsistencies have been implicated in men s rising distress levels which in turn have somewhat normed the uptake of telemental healthcare services i e phone and or video conference based therapy Given past evidence of poor engagement with telemental health among men this mixed methods study examined Australian men s use of and experiences with telemental health services relative to face to face care during the pandemic A community sample of Australian based men N age M years SD years were recruited via Facebook advertising and completed an online survey comprising quantitative items and open response qualitative questions with the aim of better understanding men s experiences with telemental healthcare services In total n of participants reported experience with telemental health and regression analyses revealed those who engaged with telemental health were on average younger more likely to be gay and university educated Men who had used telemental health were on average more satisfied with their therapy experience than those who had face to face therapy Among those who had telemental healthcare marginally lower satisfaction was observed among regional rural based relative to urban men and those who had to wait longer than months to commence therapy Qualitative findings highlighted positive aspects of telemental healthcare including comfort with accessing therapy from familiar home environments and the convenience and accessibility of telemental health alongside competing commitments and COVID restrictions Conversely drawbacks included technical limitations such as crosstalk impeding therapeutic progress disconnects and audio visual lag times and the impersonal nature of telemental healthcare services Findings broadly signal COVID induced shifts norming of the use of virtual therapy services with clear scope for improvement in the delivery of therapeutic practice using digital modalities especially among help seeking men
Racial identity and political partisanship have emerged as two important social correlates of hesitancy towards COVID vaccines in the United States To examine the relationship of these factors with respondents intention to vaccinate before the vaccine was available November December we employed a multi method approach a survey experiment that randomized a vaccine promotion message focused on racial equity in vaccine targeting stepwise regression to identify predictors of hesitancy and qualitative analysis of open ended survey questions that capture how respondents reason about vaccination intentions Experimental manipulation of a racial equity vaccine promotion message via an online survey experiment had no effect on intention to vaccinate in the full sample or in racial ethnic and partisan subsamples Descriptively we find heightened hesitancy among non Hispanic Black respondents OR p Hispanics OR p Trump voters OR p and non Voters vote Other OR p compared with non Hispanic White respondents and Biden voters Lower trust in institutions individualism and alternative media use accounted for heightened hesitancy in Trump voters but not non Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics Older age and female gender identity also persistently predicted lower vaccine intentions Qualitatively we find that most hesitant responders wanted to wait and see driven by generalized concerns about the speed of vaccine development and potential vaccine side effects but little mention of conspiracy theories Identity appears to be an important driver of vaccinate hesitancy that is not fully explained by underlying socioeconomic or attitudinal factors furthermore hesitancy was not significantly affected by racial equity messages in this setting
The COVID pandemic has been repeatedly associated with poor mental health Previous studies have mostly focused on short time frames such as around the first lockdown periods and the majority of research is based on self report questionnaires Less is known about the fluctuations of psychological states over longer time frames across the pandemic Twitter timelines of users from London and New York were investigated to shed light on potential fluctuations of several psychological states and constructs related to the pandemic Moving averages are presented for the years and Further mixed negative binomial regression models were fitted to estimate monthly word counts for the time before and during the pandemic Several psychological states and constructs fluctuated heavily on Twitter during but not during Substantial increases in levels of sadness anxiety anger and concerns about home and health were observed around the first lockdown periods in both cities The levels of most constructs decreased after the initial spike but negative emotions such as sadness anxiety and anger remained elevated throughout compared to the year prior to the pandemic Tweets from both cities showed remarkably similar temporal patterns and there are similarities to reactions found on Twitter following other previous traumatic events

By September an estimated of the global population was fully vaccinated for COVID but the global distribution of vaccines was extremely unequal with or more vaccinated in the ten countries with the highest vaccination rates and less than in the ten countries with the lowest vaccination rates Given that governments need to secure public support for investments in global vaccine sharing it is important to understand the levels and drivers of public support for international vaccine solidarity Using a factorial experiment administered to more than online survey respondents in Germany in we demonstrate that the majority of German citizens are against global inequalities in vaccine distribution Respondents are supportive of substantive funding amounts on the order of the most generous contributions provided to date though still below amounts that are likely needed for a successful global campaign Public preferences appear largely to be driven by intrinsic concern for the welfare of global populations though are in part explained by material considerations particularly risks of continued health threats from a failure to vaccinate globally Strategic considerations are of more limited importance in shaping public opinion in particular we see no evidence for free riding on contributions by other states Finally drawing on an additional survey experiment we show that there is scope to use information campaigns highlighting international health externalities to augment public support for global campaigns
The paradigm shifts of conventional office spaces for virtual workspaces which practiced Work from Home WFH due to Covid created a serious change in the lifestyles of employees due to the overlap of work and life domains in one s life Since software engineers have a possibility of permanently adapting into WFH the objective of this study is to unveil factors which would have a significant impact on the work life balance of software engineers in Sri Lanka while WFH Only a very limited researches have shed light on this context thereby this study would contribute to fill the empirical gap The study undertook a quantitative approach by collecting primary data through a questionnaire from participants based on simple random sampling and analyzing collected data based on Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling PLS SEM using Smart PLS software Study results revealed that supervisor s trust and support and the individual workspace have a significant impact on work life balance while working conditions possibility to access the organization s networks and number of children have no such significant impact Thereby the study infers that sound support and trust extended by supervisors and a designated distraction free workspace as measures to demarcate the boundary of work and life Distinctive findings of this study would primarily be fruitful for software engineers to dive into a balanced state of work and life not only during Covid but in future too Study findings will also contribute to software industry personnel and policymakers in Sri Lanka as well as other developing countries to establish effective strategies in favor of software engineers who WFH Further considering IT industry s significant contribution towards Sri Lanka s economic growth amidst Covid results of this study would be high yielding to indirectly succor IT services supported economic growth amidst the pandemic driven hardships in Sri Lanka
Artificial intelligence AI algorithms are transforming several areas of the digital world and are increasingly being applied in healthcare Mobile apps based on predictive machine learning models have the potential to improve health outcomes but there is still no consensus on how to inform doctors about their results The aim of this study was to investigate how healthcare professionals prefer to receive predictions generated by machine learning algorithms A systematic search in MEDLINE via PubMed EMBASE and Web of Science was first performed We developed a mobile app RandomIA to predict the occurrence of clinical outcomes initially for COVID and later expected to be expanded to other diseases A questionnaire called System Usability Scale SUS was selected to assess the usability of the mobile app A total of doctors from the five regions of Brazil tested RandomIA and evaluated three different ways to visualize the predictions For prognostic outcomes mechanical ventilation admission to an intensive care unit and death most doctors preferred a more complex visualization represented by a bar graph with three categories low medium and high probability and a probability density graph for each outcome For the diagnostic prediction of COVID there was also a majority preference for the same option Our results indicate that doctors could be more inclined to prefer receiving detailed results from predictive machine learning algorithms

Human mobility datasets collected from personal mobile device locations are integral to understanding how states counties and cities have collectively adapted to pervasive social disruption stemming from the COVID pandemic However while indigenous tribal communities in the United States have been disproportionately devastated by the pandemic the relatively sparse populations and data available in these hard hit tribal areas often exclude them from mobility studies We explore the effects of sparse mobility data in untangling the often inter correlated relationship between human mobility distancing orders and case growth throughout in tribal and rural areas of California Our findings account for data sparsity imprecision to show Mobility through legal tribal boundaries was unusually low but still correlated highly with case growth Case growth correlated less strongly with mobility later in the the year in all areas and State mandated distancing orders later in the year did not necessarily precede lower mobility medians especially in tribal areas It is our hope that with more timely feedback offered by mobile device datasets even in sparse areas health policy makers can better plan health emergency responses that still keep the economy vibrant across all sectors
Trust in vaccination is eroding and attitudes about vaccination have become more polarized This is an observational study of Twitter analyzing the impact that COVID had on vaccine discourse We identify the actors the language they use how their language changed and what can explain this change First we find that authors cluster into several large interpretable groups and that the discourse was greatly affected by American partisan politics Over the course of our study both Republicans and Democrats entered the vaccine conversation in large numbers forming coalitions with Antivaxxers and public health organizations respectively After the pandemic was officially declared the interactions between these groups increased Second we show that the moral and non moral language used by the various communities converged in interesting and informative ways Finally vector autoregression analysis indicates that differential responses to public health measures are likely part of what drove this convergence Taken together our results suggest that polarization around vaccination discourse in the context of COVID was ultimately driven by a trust first dynamic of political engagement
The aims of this study were to investigate parents COVID fear and anxiety levels and determine the relationship between parents COVID fear and anxiety levels and their attitudes and behaviors toward having themselves and their children vaccinated This descriptive and cross sectional type of research was conducted with parents with years old children Having a chronic disease being vaccinated intention to vaccinate their children and the children s age and school year were found to increase parents COVID fear and anxiety i p i A statistically significant correlation was found between the parents perceived levels of COVID fear and anxiety and their intentions to vaccinate their children i p i According to the study s findings the age of the child the parents vaccination and the parents intentions to vaccinate their children were predictors of COVID fear and anxiety

Because of rapid emergence and circulation of the SARS CoV variants especially Omicron which shows increased transmissibility and resistant to antibodies there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic drugs to treat COVID In this study we developed an i in vitro i cellular model to explore the regulation of ACE expression and its correlation with ACE mediated viral entry We examined ACE expression in a variety of human cell lines some of which are commonly used to study SARS CoV Using the developed model we identified a number of inhibitors which reduced ACE protein expression The greatest reduction of ACE expression was observed when CK an inhibitor of actin related protein ARP complex was combined with N ethyl N isopropyl Amiloride EIPA an inhibitor of sodium hydrogen exchangers NHEs after treatment for hours Using pseudotyped lentivirus expressing SARS CoV full length spike protein we found that ACE dependent viral entry was inhibited in CK EIPA treated Calu and MDA MB cells This study provides an i in vitro i model that can be used for screening of novel therapeutic candidates that may be warranted for further pre clinical and clinical studies on COVID countermeasures
The recent increase in the number of cases of COVID in Brazil and worldwide caused by the Omicron Variant has brought to light concern to the population and the government especially in the states most affected by the pandemic To find a way to help combat the pandemic a case study was conducted to acquire new speedboats by the Brazilian Navy BN through the application of the ELECTRE MOr multicriteria method The boats would be employed as mobile hospitals aiming to perform first aid and evacuation of patients from riverside regions to qualified hospitals Another important use would be the transport of vaccines medicines and basic supplies for riverside populations such as water food and hygiene materials For the proposed analysis we consulted three specialists from the BN who evaluated eight boat models in seven tactical operational and medical criteria After the application of the method the Guardian and RAC boats were chosen to be employed in humanitarian assistance This study brings a valuable contribution to academia and society since it represents the application of a multi criteria decision aid method in the state of the art to contribute to the solution of a real problem that affects millions of people in Brazil and worldwide
This paper has sorted out the general logic of the impact of COVID on energy consumption In the short term the epidemic has forced governments to adopt different levels of lockdown measures The total electricity consumption decreased and the share of renewable energy has increased Based on the International Energy Agency s IEA data on electricity production and consumption this paper analyzes the long term effects The COVID pandemic does affect overall electricity demand and market structure in the short term but in the long term the impact of the pandemic is detrimental to the proportion of electricity generated from renewable sources Increased especially in hard hit countries The impact on countries with different levels of development is different and countries with higher levels of economic development are better able to resist such exogenous shocks The pandemic is still ongoing how to steadily promote sustainable development In this paper we suggest that to cope with climate change to accomplish energy transformation and upgrading or even sustainable development we should not only rely on reducing human activities but give more support to countries with low development levels in realizing sustainable development

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV spike protein and prions use common pathogenic pathways to induce toxicity in neurons Infectious prions rapidly activate the p mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK pathway and SARS CoV spike proteins rapidly activate both the p MAPK and c Jun NH terminal kinase JNK pathways through toll like receptor signaling indicating the potential for similar neurotoxicity causing prion and prion like disease In this review we analyze the roles of autophagy inhibition molecular mimicry elevated intracellular p levels and reduced Wild type p induced phosphatase Wip and dual specificity phosphatase DUSP expression in neurons in the disease process The pathways induced by the spike protein via toll like receptor activation induce both the upregulation of PrP sup C sup the normal isoform of the prion protein PrP and the expression of β amyloid Through the spike protein dependent elevation of p levels via β amyloid metabolism increased PrP sup C sup expression can lead to PrP misfolding and impaired autophagy generating prion disease We conclude that according to the age of the spike protein exposed patient and the state of their cellular autophagy activity excess sustained activity of p in neurons may be a catalytic factor in neurodegeneration An autoimmune reaction via molecular mimicry likely also contributes to neurological symptoms Overall results suggest that neurodegeneration is in part due to the intensity and duration of spike protein exposure patient advanced age cellular autophagy activity and activation function and regulation of p Finally the neurologically damaging effects can be cumulatively spike protein dependent whether exposure is by natural infection or more substantially by repeated mRNA vaccination
Background The role of non invasive continuous positive airway pressure CPAP or Non invasive ventilation NIV respiratory support NIRS as a primary oxygenation strategy for COVID patients with acute severe hypoxic respiratory failure AHRF as opposed to invasive mechanical ventilation invasive MV is uncertain While NIRS may prevent complications related to invasive MV prolonged NIRS and delays in intubation may lead to adverse outcomes This study was conducted to assess the role of NIRS in COVID hypoxemic respiratory failure and to explore the variables associated with NRIS failure Methods This is a single center observational study of two distinct waves of severe COVID patients admitted to the ICU Patients initially managed with non invasive respiratory support with laboratory confirmed SARS CoV in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure were included Demographics comorbidities admission laboratory variables and ICU admission scores were extracted from electronic health records Univariate and multiple logistic regression was used to identify predictive factors for invasive mechanical ventilation Kaplan Meier survival curves were used to summarise survival between the ventilatory and time to intubation groups Results There were patients of which were managed with NIRS as an initial ventilation strategy There was a high incidence of failure Admission APACHE II score SOFA score HACOR score ROX index and PaO FiO were all predictive of NIRS failure Daily days HACOR scores and ROX index measurements highly predicted NIRS failure Late NIRS failure hours was independently associated with increased mortality Conclusion NIRS is effective as first line therapy for COVID patients with AHRF However failure particularly delayed failure is associated with significant mortality Early prediction of NIRS failure may prevent adverse outcomes

The interaction of electromagnetic EM waves with the COVID virus is studied to define the frequencies that cause maximum energy absorption by the virus and the power level needed to cause a lethal temperature rise The full wave EM simulator is used to model the virus and study the effects of its size and dielectric properties on the absorbed power across a wide range of frequencies The results confirm potential resonance conditions where specific frequencies produce maximum absorption and subsequent temperature rise that can destroy the virus Furthermore the study confirms that maximum power deposition in the virus occurs at specific wavelengths depending on its size Also the simulation is used to find the power required to destroy the virus and determine the total power required to destroy it in an oral activity such as coughing made by infected individuals Furthermore the study explained why irradiation by UV C band is effective to decrease virus activity or even eradicate it
Public bicycle can be a disease resilient travel mode during the i coronavirus disease i COVID pandemic Nonetheless its evidence on public bicycle sharing is still inconclusive This study used Bayesian structural time series models and causal impact inference for the data on the daily ridership of public bicycles in Seoul South Korea for days from January to December The study found that the usage of public bicycles was robust against the COVID pandemic even in densely populated Seoul Compared with the pre pandemic period public bicycles usage was unaffected on days when weather conditions such as snow rain and wind speed were not as severe as well as on days with non seasonal event factors such as weekdays public holidays and traditional Korean holidays In addition its robustness against the pandemic became more pronounced as the number of bicycle racks increased and the intensity of social distancing increased However public bicycles were in demand primarily for leisure and exercise not for travel during the pandemic Public bicycle sharing can be a disease resilient travel mode Continuous investment in infrastructure such as bicycle paths and public bicycle is required to become a more resilient travel mode against infectious diseases
The SARS CoV Omicron variants BA BA and BA have appeared recently in India and have already spread to over countries They have acquired additional mutations in their spike protein compared to BA branching away on the SARS CoV phylogenetic tree These added mutations have raised concerns about the impact on viral pathogenicity transmissibility and immune evasion properties of the new variants
Aim This study aimed to investigate early rehabilitation in the intensive care unit ICU for patients with severe coronavirus disease COVID who require mechanical ventilation Methods Twenty patients with severe COVID COVID group who were admitted to the ICU between April and March were included For the control non COVID group individuals were selected among ICU patients admitted between April and March The controls were propensity score matched by age sex and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment SOFA score Results In the COVID group the percentage of extubated patients was significantly higher Furthermore mechanical ventilation and lengths of ICU stay were also significantly longer There were no significant differences in discharge outcomes or mortality but there was a significant difference in the number of muscle relaxants and steroid treatments utilized with the COVID group requiring more of these medications The percentage of patients who achieved sitting on the edge of a bed was also significantly higher in the COVID group but the days between the first rehabilitation and first sitting were significantly greater in this group Conclusion Early rehabilitation of patients with COVID may be an effective measure to promote recovery However continued investigation is warranted
Coronavirus disease COVID is a highly contagious lethal infection that has successfully spread all across the world The novel coronavirus that is behind the menace and spread of COVID is the next in the lineage of the i Coronaviridae i family of viruses which had previously given two deadly viruses with limited geographical extent After sustaining for more than two years the virus is still active and keeps on mutating to evade human immunity The impact of COVID is felt not only by patients of COVID who go through the trauma but also by non COVID patients due to the non pharmacological interventions NPIs enforced Patients in the orthopedic departments suffered a huge blow as their rehabilitation practices were stalled due to a lack of health professionals and also restrictions imposed But to soften the blow usage of telemedicine was done in some instances so that the essential therapies can continue despite the movement restrictions imposed COVID has disrupted many aspects of human life including clinical practices and this endeavor is to review those aspects and provide conclusions if any The aim of the study is to review the available resources regarding Indoor orthopedic practice during the COVID pandemic and draw a conclusion that can help further research on the aforementioned topic

Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms DRESS syndrome is a rare drug reaction that commonly presents with rash fever lymphadenopathy eosinophilia and multiorgan involvement We present a case of this syndrome in a year old male who presented with a diffuse erythematous morbilliform rash with high fever and elevated liver enzymes Upon history taking the patient reported acute onset of multiple seizures that required intubation and ICU admission six weeks prior which started hours after receiving the Johnson and Johnson Janssen coronavirus disease COVID vaccine During that hospitalization he was given antiseizure medications Keppra levetiracetam and Dilantin phenytoin which he was eventually discharged home with During our encounter with the patient Dermatology was consulted and recommended punch skin biopsy which revealed spongiotic dermatitis with subcorneal pustules along with superficial perivascular and mixed lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrate with dermal edema and rare eosinophils Given these findings in conjunction with the patient s fever elevated liver function and cervical lymphadenopathy the rash was consistent with DRESS syndrome or a pustular drug eruption likely secondary to phenytoin or levetiracetam This case was eventually resolved with treatment with oral and topical corticosteroids and close outpatient follow up with Dermatology Prompt diagnosis and treatment of DRESS syndrome are therefore critical as the mortality rate can be as high as in the setting of liver failure
Background In this study we aimed to evaluate the health related quality of life HRQL in patients with severe coronavirus disease COVID six months after their hospitalization and compare it to that of non hospitalized patients with mild COVID and healthy controls Methodology Participants were enrolled between September and April and included hospitalized COVID patients at General Hospital of Athens Hippocration who had been discharged at least six months prior to enrollment non hospitalized patients with COVID and healthy controls Collected data included demographics disease severity medication history and comorbidities Participants completed a EuroQol Dimensions Levels EQ D L a Short Form version SF v a Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue FACIT F and a Post COVID Functional Status Scale PCFSS regarding HRQL before and six months after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus In the case of healthy controls two sets of questionnaires were completed at least six months apart Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version software IBM Corp Armonk NY USA Results A total of participants were enrolled Hospitalized patients with COVID demonstrated a statistically significant deterioration in most parameters of SF v as well as both parameters of the EQ D L and FACIT F questionnaires Hospitalized patients exhibited worse results in SF v and EQ D L when compared to both healthy controls as well as those with mild COVID p Hospitalized women in particular were shown to fare worse than other women in parameters associated with both mental psychological and physical health p Hospitalized patients between and years old demonstrated a statistically significant drop in the scores of all three main questionnaires compared to their previous health status p Hospitalized patients between and years old exhibited a similar trend but statistical significance was achieved in fewer parameters HRQL decline was greater in both age groups compared to that of healthy and milder disease counterparts There was a significant correlation between the results from the three main questionnaires Similarly PCFS scale values were shown to correlate with disease severity hospitalization or not and age Conclusions HRQL remained noticeably impacted six months after hospitalization due to COVID The physical and mental psychological stress of severe COVID translated into lasting health deterioration especially for women and those aged years old The use of questionnaires such as those implemented in this study might help in the early detection of patients who could benefit from rehabilitation programs Psychological as well as physical and social support is crucial to alleviate the burden of post COVID symptomatology and expedite the recovery of this group of patients
Objective Throughout the coronavirus disease COVID pandemic multiple factors have been associated with poor prognosis for those infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV virus Age obesity and medical comorbidities have been linked to poor outcomes including admission to the intensive care unit ICU acute renal failure stroke myocardial infarction MI mechanical ventilation and even death for hospitalized COVID patients Although diabetes mellitus DM has also been included in this set of medical comorbidities there have been inconsistencies in the currently available body of literature suggesting that mortality rates may or may not be correlated to elevated glycosylated hemoglobin HbA c levels This study aims to determine whether there is a correlation or trend between a range of HbA c values and in hospital mortality among patients admitted to the hospital with a COVID diagnosis Materials and methods This study was a retrospective review of electronic medical records at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton CA Any patient above the age of admitted to the hospital during a predetermined time frame with either a positive COVID PCR test on admission or during their hospital stay was included in the study These medical charts were reviewed for HbA c values during admission or within three months prior to admission In hospital mortality was then recorded for each medical record with an available HbA c value Hospital discharge summaries were used to delineate comorbidities including chronic kidney disease cerebrovascular disease coronary artery disease congestive heart failure cancer history or history of deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism among the patients included in the study Average HbA c values were recorded for the mortality and non mortality groups and their statistical significance was calculated Results In this retrospective study HbA c levels were compared to mortality rates among adult patients admitted to the hospital with a concurrent COVID diagnosis From the analysis conducted those with higher HbA c levels did not have an increased rate of in hospital mortality and those with lower HbA c levels did not have a decreased rate of in hospital mortality Comorbidity data as a confounding factor was also reviewed and excluded from the final analysis The SARS CoV vaccine was also excluded as a confounder in this study by selecting a specific time frame for data collection Based on our results we propose that HbA c levels likely have little to minimal correlation with mortality rates among hospitalized COVID patients Conclusion In this study we show that HbA c levels regardless of concurrent comorbidities are unlikely to be correlated to mortality rates among hospitalized COVID patients HbA c levels should not be used as a marker for whether these patients should be admitted to the hospital for further inpatient management or discharged from the emergency department
Introduction The importance of coronavirus disease COVID free surgical pathways during the coronavirus disease COVID pandemic has been demonstrated However the extent of protective measures to be applied against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV particularly before vaccines became available remained unclear Methods This retrospective study included all SARS CoV negative patients admitted to the COVID free pathway of a regional abdominal surgery hub center in Northern Italy over months before the vaccination campaign During the first seven months basic protective measures against SARS CoV were adopted surgical masks swabs for symptomatic patients and intra or interhospital transfers since patients were treated as effectively negative standard management During the last five months advanced measures were implemented enhanced personal protections and systematic control swabs as patients were considered potentially positive advanced management The aim of this article was to compare SARS CoV incidence and surgical outcomes in these periods Results A total of and patients were admitted under standard and advanced management respectively pre admission data differed only in the rate of previous SARS CoV infection versus p The SARS CoV incidence was and for standard and advanced periods respectively p Two internal outbreaks developed during the standard phase The advanced protocol significantly increased the rate of patients re tested for SARS CoV versus p and allowed early detection of all infections which remained sporadic Surgical outcomes were similar Conclusions Advanced management was instrumental in detecting positive patients early and preventing outbreaks without affecting surgical results accordingly it stands as a reproducible model for future pandemic scenarios
Background In Romania as in other parts of the world the family doctor is the first to make contact with a healthy patient and is also the first to notice even the smallest pathological changes In the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV pandemic the patient s communication with the family doctor became even closer and some behavioral changes could be easily noticed Objective To assess the symptoms of anxiety and depression in the Romanian population using social media platforms in the context of the COVID pandemic Methods We conducted an anonymous web based cross sectional survey consisting of questions related to general characteristics age gender education inhabitancy residence smoking status and alcohol consumption and adapted GAD item General Anxiety Disorders questionnaire and PHQ item Patient Health Questionnaire This questionnaire was sent to volunteers in an electronic format through a social network Facebook Twitter The data collected were statistically processed using IBM SPSS v IBM Corp Armonk NY The inclusion criteria were age over years and no history of chronic disease The exclusion criteria consisted of the absence of a mental illness diagnosis Results From the respondents cases were selected for statistical analysis after applying the exclusion criteria The mean age was SD CI with a minimum of years and a maximum of years Eighty four point nine percent N of all study participants are female and N live in the urban area A total of were diagnosed with COVID of which were male and were female N reported moderate symptoms of anxiety during the last two weeks before the survey while N had severe anxiety Twenty two point two percent N of the participants reported moderate symptoms of depression while N had moderately severe symptoms and N could be diagnosed with severe depression A greater likelihood of screening for depression diagnosis was associated with ages between and years OR CI i P i and years OR CI i P i and and years OR CI i P i Also a tendency was observed for women to be more prone to high levels of anxiety OR CI i P i and depression OR CI i P i Conclusions Regarding the high prevalence of depression and anxiety especially in women appropriate measures for the risk categories should be applied In the new social context created by the COVID pandemic screening for psychiatric and psychological disorders should be performed by telemedicine
Introduction As coronavirus disease COVID immunizations become more common concerns about their safety and reactogenicity have grown It is important to assess and analyze the post vaccination side effects of several COVID vaccines that have been licensed in Pakistan Methods and results A comparative cross sectional study was conducted between October and January to collect data on the side effects produced by different COVID vaccines An online survey was conducted to gather data on participants demographics clinical profiles COVID profiles as well as the intensity and side effects of COVID vaccines Statistical Package for the Social Sciences SPSS version IBM Corp Armonk NY was used to analyze the data collected Out of participants were males of participants received messenger RNA mRNA vaccine received viral vector vaccine received inactivated vaccine and further of the total subjects were completely immunized The majority of the symptoms were mild to moderate in degree Approximately of the individuals reported experiencing serious adverse effects Injection site pain was noted to be the most remarkable post vaccination side effect followed by fever and fatigue Prior COVID infection was not associated with the severity of any COVID vaccine related side effect p i i except dyspnea Younger participants and the female gender were substantially linked to post vaccination adverse effects Conclusion In comparison to viral vector and inactivated vaccines our data suggest that the mRNA based vaccination causes more severe adverse effects and the majority of them were mild to moderate in severity Participants who had previously contracted COVID were not at a higher risk of developing additional vaccine related side effects
Background In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of the coronavirus disease COVID pandemic induced social restrictions including face masks on patients with hearing problems Methodology This cross sectional survey study was conducted in an ENT tertiary care center After signing the consent form we invited study subjects with hearing disabilities who were using unilateral or bilateral hearing aids to participate in filling out the study survey The study questionnaire was completed by subjects The questionnaire included various questions about the respondent s demographics hearing aids and communication with a face mask during COVID restrictions All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version IBM Corp Armonk NY USA Results Overall of the study sample agreed that understanding people wearing face masks is harder because their speech is muffled whereas disagreed and were neutral While agreed that understanding is harder because they cannot see their mouth moving disagreed and were neutral More than half of the study sample agreed that they are worried about how they will communicate with others if wearing face masks becomes more common However of the participants thought that they can still hear people when they speak to them from a safe distance Of note of subjects disagreed about tinnitus being worse since the lockdown Conclusions The widespread use of face masks had a significant impact on the daily communication and interactions of people with hearing impairments More research is needed to find creative ways to help these patients improve their daily communication and social interactions

The COVID pandemic has significantly changed people s lifestyles and wearing surgical masks in outdoor public spaces has become commonplace However few studies have explored the impact of wearing masks on outdoor thermal comfort in different seasons From May to February a series of longitudinal experiments were conducted in Xiamen China to examine the effect of wearing surgical masks on outdoor thermal comfort Forty two participants took part in the experiments with and without masks During the experiments the thermal perceptions of the subjects and environmental thermal parameters were collected Differences in outdoor thermal comfort between subjects wearing masks and those not wearing masks were determined in summer autumn and winter Results showed that the subjects wearing masks had lower neutral temperatures and this difference was particularly pronounced in summer and exacerbated by walking in warm environments masks reduced thermal comfort and discomfort associated with masks was worse when walking than when sitting wearing masks significantly worsened facial comfort and increased chest discomfort as summer turned to winter the impact of masks on facial comfort decreased radiation and air temperature were the environmental parameters with the greatest impact on outdoor thermal sensation Subjects who wore masks preferred lower temperatures radiation and humidity and higher wind speeds
The outbreak of COVID and subsequent pandemic containment measures have significantly affected our daily life which has been extensively examined in the existing scholarship However the existing scholarship has done little on the jobs housing relationship impacts of COVID We attempted to fill this gap by looking into this using an excess commuting approach The approach allows us to analyse a series of jobs housing matrices based on the location based service big data of around fifty million individuals in the Pearl River Delta PRD China before and amid COVID In the PRD a zero COVID policy was implemented which presents a distinct and interesting context for our study We found that after the COVID outbreak residences and employment became more centrally located in downtowns which is opposite to the trend of suburbanization elsewhere in the whole PRD the minimum and maximum commutes became smaller while the actual commute became larger indicating the simultaneous presences of some paradoxical phenomena a better spatial juxtaposition of jobs and housing more compressed distribution of jobs and housing and longer average actual commutes inter city commutes from and to large cities were significantly confined and decreased while new inter city commuters in smaller cities emerged it is more likely for the less educated and female workers to observe smaller minimum commutes amid COVID This paper illustrates the potential of big data in the longitudinal study of jobs housing relationships and excess commuting It also produces new insights into such relationships in a unique context where stringent anti COVID policies have been continuously in place

The novel coronavirus COVID pandemic has completely changed our lives and how we interact with the world The pandemic has brought about a pressing need to have effective disinfection practices that can be incorporated into daily life They are needed to limit the spread of infections through surfaces and air particularly in public settings Most of the current methods utilize chemical disinfectants which can be laborious and time consuming Ultraviolet UV irradiation is a proven and powerful means of disinfection There has been a rising interest in the implementation of UV disinfection robots by various public institutions such as hospitals long term care homes airports and shopping malls The use of UV based disinfection robots could make the disinfection process faster and more efficient The objective of this review is to equip readers with the necessary background on UV disinfection and provide relevant discussion on various aspects of UV robots
This paper explores the role of a particular set of commonly occurring temporal meanings relating to the shared experience of being in a pandemic e g i in these unprecedented times i and how these foster ambient affiliation on Twitter Temporal meanings can be realised as a range of grammatical structures in texts and are linguistic resources that add meaning in terms of dimensions such as manner time or place to the main activities entities or events in a clause While often viewed in terms of their role in how experience is represented we suggest they play a pivotal interpersonal role in how values are positioned and how social bonds are offered to ambient audiences The paper also draws on communing affiliation a system in the ambient affiliation framework for understanding how people share and contest values in social media environments to show how these temporal meanings are functioning Corpus based discourse analysis of the contribution of temporal meanings to communing affiliation in a large of corpus of COVID tweets was undertaken Three major affiliation strategies that these temporal meanings were involved in were observed centring in the service of convoking affiliation contrasting in the service of finessing affiliation and accentuating in the service of promoting affiliation
In this paper I study discursive practices of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the COVID pandemic In response to the pandemic political leadership across the globe had to take tough decisions such as restrictions on the social and personal lives of individuals This meant addressing concerns over ensuring compliance with these restrictions I examine how Modi managed these concerns in his communication with the Indian polity over TV and radio broadcasts I do so in instances where Modi gave specific instructions about following restrictions or other COVID appropriate behaviours Using discourse analysis I analyse data from two prominent ways of communicating in the pandemic Mann Ki Baat and addresses to the nation Analyses show that Modi developed two sets of non electoral relations across his communication which treated compliance as normatively expected a between Modi and Indians and b among Indians themselves These relations made way for treating audiences as those who are in specific social roles where duty and service were normative Instructions and their compliance were embedded in these roles and treated as expected and consequently moral acts Modi s discursive practices worked to perform a politics of service and duty where compliance is ultimately treated as expected service
Reactive oxygen species ROS are an important part of the inflammatory response during infection but can also promote DNA damage Due to the sustained inflammation in severe Covid we hypothesized that hospitalized Covid patients would be characterized by increased levels of oxidative DNA damage and dysregulation of the DNA repair machinery
The SARS CoV outbreak and emergence of COVID resulted in the development of different vaccines based on various platforms to combat the disease While the conventional platforms of inactivated live attenuated subunit proteins and virus like particles VLPs have provided efficient and safe vaccines novel platforms of viral vector and nucleic acid based vaccines opened up new horizons for vaccine development The emergence of COVID pandemic showed that the availability of platforms with high possibility of quick translation from bench to bedside is a prerequisite step in vaccine development in pandemics Moreover parallel development of different platforms as well as considering the shipping storage condition distribution infrastructure and route of administration are key players for successful and robust response This review highlights the lessons learned from the current COVID pandemic in terms of vaccine development to provide quick response to future outbreaks of infectious diseases and the importance of vaccine platform in its storage condition and shipping Finally the potential application of current COVID vaccine platforms in the treatment of non infectious diseases has been discussed

Despite the reports on glomerulonephritis associated with COVID mRNA vaccines no study has reported about the dense deposit disease DDD Here we present a case of hilar lymphadenopathy after the COVID mRNA vaccination following which the patient developed tubulointerstitial nephritis TIN and DDD A year old man received his second dose of mRNA vaccine and on the next day he developed fever urticaria and dyspnea On further examination he had pleural effusion and right hilar lymphadenopathies which were improved with conservative therapy After days of the second vaccination he developed renal dysfunction and new onset hematuria Light microscopy findings by renal biopsy revealed apparent mesangial cell proliferation increased mesangial matrix in the glomeruli and diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration in the interstitium Immunofluorescence analysis revealed positive results for IgG and IgM negative results for IgA and positive results for C with a garland pattern on the capillary walls Electron microscopy revealed that severe cell proliferation in the capillary rumen and continuous thickened and highly dark stained spotty dense deposits in the glomerular basement membrane and noncontinuous spotty dense deposits in the tubular basement membrane Based on the decrease in C and pathological findings TIN accompanied with DDD was diagnosed The mRNA vaccine might have contributed to the development of lymphadenopathies TIN and DDD in this case Moreover TIN and DDD might be associated with the activated alternative pathway induced by the mRNA vaccine
Telehealth use for primary care has skyrocketed since the onset of the COVID pandemic Enthusiasts have praised this new medium of delivery as a way to increase access to care while potentially reducing spending Over two years into the pandemic the question of whether telehealth will lead to an increase in primary care utilization and spending has been met with contradictory answers Some evidence suggests that telehealth may be used as an addition to in person visits Others like Dixit et al have found that telehealth can actually substitute for in person care rather than contribute to overutilization As telehealth continues to evolve outcomes utilization and quality of care should be closely monitored
COVID is a fast spreading pandemic that is caused by SARS CoV viral pathogen Combination therapy of the antiviral favipiravir and the anticoagulant apixaban is one of the efficient treatment regimens Therefore development of novel and sensitive methods for simultaneous analysis of such combination is highly advantageous Herein two eco friendly simple rapid and cost effective spectrofluorometric methods were evolved for the estimation of favipiravir and apixaban in pharmaceutical and biological matrices Method I was based on analysis of favipiravir and apixaban by the first order derivative of the conventional fluorescence spectra obtained after excitation at nm where favipiravir and apixaban were detected at and nm respectively Method II relied on dual scan synchronous spectrofluorometry in which favipiravir was determined at nm using Δλ nm while apixaban was analyzed at nm using Δλ nm Method optimization was performed for selecting the optimum conditions at which maximum sensitivity and selectivity were obtained This report is the first one that describes simultaneous analysis of favipiravir and apixaban by synchronous spectrofluorometry The developed methods were successfully applied to evaluate favipiravir and apixaban in spiked human plasma and in pharmaceutical dosages with high recoveries and low RSD
Introduction Mental health and wellbeing of the dental team has been brought into sharp focus during the COVID pandemic Despite this renewed interest there has been longstanding issues with poor mental health and wellbeing in the dental profession for some time While there is some evidence that documents poor mental wellbeing amongst dentists there appears to be a lack of evidence concerning dental care professionals Aims To explore the level of mental wellbeing and stress amongst dental hygienists and therapists DHTs in South West England Method An online survey was distributed to DHTs in South West England via two professional networks Results A total of surveys were completed The mean levels of reported wellbeing were lower amongst DHTs than the general population and of respondents reported high anxiety levels Younger respondents reported lower levels of life satisfaction Plus of dental therapists reported performing solely dental hygiene treatments with those performing no dental therapy reporting lower happiness levels Conclusion Low mental wellbeing amongst DHTs in the South West has been identified in this survey and this is likely to impact negatively on the morale and motivation of the workforce leading to increased levels of absenteeism and ultimately loss of colleagues from the dental workforce The stress encountered by DHTs is largely workplace related and therefore there is an increased need for team and organisation delivered interventions to improve mental wellbeing for this group
Vaccines have reduced the burden of COVID disease in the UK since their introduction in December At the time of their introduction it was unclear the extent to which COVID vaccines would be accepted and how spatial variations in uptake would emerge driven by socio demographic characteristics In this study data from a large scale cross sectional study of over adults surveyed in September and October was used to provide sub national forecasts of COVID vaccine uptake across the UK Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification was deployed to forecast COVID vaccine acceptance before vaccine rollout across regions of the UK Although it was found that a majority of the UK adult population would likely take the vaccine there were substantial heterogeneities in uptake intent across the UK Large urban areas including London and North West England females Black or Black British ethnicities and Polish speakers were among the least likely to state an intent to vaccinate These predicted spatial trends were validated by comparison to observed observed COVID vaccine uptake in late The methodological approaches deployed in this validated forecasting study may be replicable for the prediction of routine childhood immunisation uptake Given recent pandemic induced disruptions to routine immunisation systems reliable sub national forecasts of vaccine uptake may provide policymakers and stakeholders early warning signals of potential vaccine confidence issues
Physical activity PA levels may have changed since the COVID pandemic However these changes are not well understood The study aimed to describe the PA level and examine the predictive factors of a health enhancing PA level among working women in Singapore two years into the COVID pandemic We undertook a cross sectional descriptive correlational study Three hundred participants were recruited and completed the online questionnaire between October and November In the PA analysis of participants only of the participants achieved a health enhancing PA level while of the total sample sat for h or more daily In the univariate analysis occupation nationality monthly income and average daily sitting hours were significantly associated with a high PA level The current mode of work living arrangement and health promoting lifestyle profile II_physical activity score remained significant in both univariate and multivariate analyses Participants who worked from home and stayed with their families were less likely to achieve a health enhancing PA level than those who had a regular workplace and did not stay with their families Working women with a health promoting physically active lifestyle were likelier to achieve a health enhancing PA level The long daily sitting time and suboptimal health enhancing PA participation underscore the need for health promotion initiatives for working women
Reliable and effective diagnostic systems are of vital importance for COVID specifically for triage and screening procedures In this work a fully automatic diagnostic system based on chest X ray images CXR has been proposed It relies on the few shot paradigm which allows to work with small databases Furthermore three components have been added to improve the diagnosis performance a region proposal network which makes the system focus on the lungs a novel cost function which adds expert knowledge by giving specific penalties to each misdiagnosis and an ensembling procedure integrating multiple image comparisons to produce more reliable diagnoses Moreover the COVID SC dataset has been introduced comprising almost AnteroPosterior CXR images namely negative and positive according to the RT PCR test Expert radiologists divided the negative images into three categories normal lungs COVID related diseases and other diseases and the positive images into four severity levels This entails the most complete COVID dataset in terms of patient diversity The proposed system has been compared with state of the art methods in the COVIDGR public database achieving the highest accuracy and the most robust results An ablation study proved that each system component contributes to improve the overall performance The procedure has also been validated on the COVID SC dataset under different scenarios with accuracies ranging from to In conclusion our proposal provides a good accuracy appropriate for the early detection of COVID
A strong association between obesity and COVID complications and a lack of prognostic factors that explain the unpredictable severity among these patients still exist despite the various vaccination programs The expression of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE the main receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV is enhanced in obese individuals The occurrence of frequent genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in ACE is suggested to increase COVID severity Accordingly we hypothesize that obesity associated ACE polymorphisms increase the severity of COVID In this study we profiled eight frequently reported ACE SNPs in a cohort of lean and obese COVID patients n We highlight the significant association of rs rs rs and rs with increased severity in obese COVID patients as compared to lean counterparts These co morbid associated SNPs tend to positively correlate hence proposing possible functional cooperation to ACE regulation In obese COVID patients rs rs and rs are significantly associated with increased blood nitrogen urea and creatinine levels In conclusion we highlight the contribution of ACE SNPs in enhancing COVID severity in obese individuals The results from this study provide a basis for further investigations required to shed light on the underlying mechanisms of COVID associated SNPs in COVID obese patients

Coronavirus disease Covid pandemic have demonstrated the importantance of vaccines in disease prevention Self amplifying mRNA vaccines could be another option for disease prevention if demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic Phase of this randomized double blinded placebo controlled trial N assessed the safety tolerability and immunogenicity in healthy young and older adults of ascending levels of one dose ARCT a self amplifying mRNA vaccine against Covid Phase N tested two doses of ARCT given days apart During phase ARCT was well tolerated up to one μg dose and two μg doses Local solicited AEs namely injection site pain and tenderness were more common in ARCT vaccinated while systemic solicited AEs mainly fatigue headache and myalgia were reported in and of ARCT and placebo recipients respectively Seroconversion rate for anti S IgG was in all cohorts except for the μg one dose in younger adults and the μg one dose in older adults Anti S IgG and neutralizing antibody titers showed a general increase with increasing dose and overlapped with titers in Covid convalescent patients T cell responses were also observed in response to stimulation with S protein peptides Taken collectively ARCT is immunogenic and has favorable safety profile for further development
Monocyte distribution width MDW is a novel marker of monocyte activation which is known to occur in the immune response to viral pathogens Our objective was to determine the performance of MDW and other leukocyte parameters as screening tests for SARS CoV and influenza infection This was a prospective cohort analysis of adult patients who underwent complete blood count CBC and SARS CoV or influenza testing in an Emergency Department ED between January and July The primary outcome was SARS CoV or influenza infection Secondary outcomes were measures of severity of illness including inpatient hospitalization critical care admission hospital lengths of stay and mortality Descriptive statistics and test performance measures were evaluated for monocyte percentage MDW white blood cell WBC count and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio NLR ED patient visits were included SARS CoV testing was performed during visits with a positivity rate of influenza testing was performed during with a positivity rate of MDW was elevated in patients with SARS Cov median U IQR or influenza median U IQR infection as compared to those without U IQR and U respectively P Monocyte percentage WBC and NLR values were within normal range in patients testing positive for either virus MDW identified SARS CoV and influenza positive patients with an area under the curve AUC of CI and CI respectively At the accepted cut off value of U for MDW sensitivities were CI for SARS CoV and CI for influenza compared to sensitivities below for monocyte percentage WBC and NLR MDW negative predictive values were CI and CI respectively for SARS CoV and influenza Monocyte Distribution Width MDW available as part of a routine complete blood count CBC with differential may be a useful indicator of SARS CoV or influenza infection
The generation time distribution reflecting the time between successive infections in transmission chains is a key epidemiological parameter for describing COVID transmission dynamics However because exact infection times are rarely known it is often approximated by the serial interval distribution This approximation holds under the assumption that infectors and infectees share the same incubation period distribution which may not always be true We estimated incubation period and serial interval distributions using transmission pairs reconstructed by investigating confirmed cases in China in January February and developed an inferential framework to estimate the generation time distribution that accounts for variation over time due to changes in epidemiology sampling biases and public health and social measures We identified substantial reductions over time in the serial interval and generation time distributions Our proposed method provides more reliable estimation of the temporal variation in the generation time distribution improving assessment of transmission dynamics
Booster doses for the ongoing COVID pandemic are under consideration in many countries We report a three month follow up of participants in a fourth vaccine dose study comparing BNT b and mRNA administered four months after a third BNT b dose The primary outcomes are the levels of IgG neutralizing antibodies and microneutralization and the secondary outcomes are the levels of IgA and T cell activation and clinical outcomes of SARS CoV infection and substantial symptomatic disease Waning of the immune response is evident during follow up with an β CI and β CI multiplicative decay per week of IgG and neutralizing antibodies respectively in the mRNA group and of β CI and β CI respectively in the BNT b group Direct neutralization of Omicron variants is low relative to ancestral strains Cumulatively over the study period both vaccines show little efficacy against infection but were highly efficacious against substantial symptomatic disease IRR CI and IRR CI for mRNA and BNT b respectively These results are informative for further boosting policy making Trial registration numbers clinicaltrials gov NCT and NCT
Several studies have shown that SARS CoV BA omicron is an immune escape variant Meanwhile however omicron BA and BA became dominant in many countries and replaced BA As both have several mutations compared to BA we analyzed whether BA and BA show further immune escape relative to BA Here we characterized neutralization profiles against the BA and BA omicron sub variants in plasma samples from individuals with different history of exposures to infection vaccination and found that unvaccinated individuals after a single exposure to BA had limited cross neutralizing antibodies to pre omicron variants and to BA Consequently our antigenic map including all Variants of Concern and BA BA and BA omicron sub variants showed that all omicron sub variants are distinct to pre omicron variants but that the three omicron variants are also antigenically distinct from each other The antibody landscapes illustrate that cross neutralizing antibodies against the current antigenic space as described in our maps are generated only after three or more exposures to antigenically close variants but also after two exposures to antigenically distant variants Here we describe the antigenic space inhabited by the relevant SARS CoV variants the understanding of which will have important implications for further vaccine strain adaptations

In this study we investigated the genomic variability of alpha VOC of SARS CoV in Pakistan in context of the global population of this variant A set of whole genome sequences of Pakistani samples of alpha variant retrieved from GISAID were aligned in MAFFT and used as an input to the Coronapp web application Phylogenetic tree was constructed through maximum likelihood method by downloading the whole genome sequences of alpha variant for each of the countries having the largest number of Pakistani diasporas We detected mutations which were further categorized into missense mutations silent mutations mutations in non coding regions in frame deletions in frame insertion frameshift deletions frameshift insertions stop gained variants and stop gained deletion We found NSP and Spike as the most variable proteins with and mutations respectively However some characteristic mutations like Δ S G R N and T I I T del ORF ab were missing in the Pakistani population of alpha variant Likewise R K NSP P L NSP and A V H Y NSP were found for the first time in this study Interestingly Y deletion S had prevalence in Pakistan but globally it was just prevalent Likewise R S substitution ORF a F frameshift deletion L insertion L V substitution ORF and N Y NSP had prevalence locally but globally they were just and prevalent respectively The phylogeny analysis revealed that majority of Pakistani samples were grouped together in the same clusters with Italian and Spanish samples suggesting the transmission of alpha variant to Pakistan from these western European countries
What are the effects of right wing populism in the struggle against COVID We explore data from Brazil a country whose populist radical right wing president was among the prominent denialists regarding the effects of the pandemic Using cross sectional and weekly panel data for municipalities during we present evidence that social distancing was weakened and the number of cases and deaths were higher in places where the president had received greater electoral support during the presidential elections Placebo tests using traditional right wing vote and data on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS before the pandemic outbreak indicate that the former does not correlate with health outcomes and the populist share of the vote does not correlate with the latter Hence we find strong indications that right wing populism relates to a poor response to the disease
We report the development of a label antibody enzyme and amplification free ratiometric fluorescent biosensor for low cost and rapid less than min diagnosis of COVID from isolated RNA samples The biosensor is designed on the basis of cytosine modified antisense oligonucleotides specific for either N gene or RdRP gene that can form silver nanoclusters AgNCs with both green and red emission on an oligonucleotide via a one step synthesis process The presence of the target RNA sequence of SARS CoV causes a dual emission ratiometric signal transduction resulting in a limit of detection of to nM and appropriate linear ranges with no need for any further amplification fluorophore or design with a special DNA fragment With this strategy five different ratiometric fluorescent probes are designed and how the T C ratio the length of the stem region and the number of cytosines in the loop structure and at the end of the cluster stabilizing template can affect the biosensor sensitivity is investigated Furthermore the effect of graphene oxide GO on the ratiometric behavior of nanoclusters is demonstrated and the concentration time dependent new competitive mechanism between aggregation caused quenching ACQ and aggregation induced emission enhancement AIE for the developed ssDNA AgNCs GO nanohybrids is proposed Finally the performance of the designed ratiometric biosensor has been validated using the RNA extract obtained from more than clinical samples and the results have been confirmed by the FDA approved reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR diagnostic method The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the best probe is more than with an area under the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve of
Studies have consistently shown crowds contribute to home advantage in the National Basketball Association NBA by inspiring home team effort distracting opponents and influencing referees Quantifying the effect of crowds is challenging however due to potential co occurring drivers of home advantage e g travel location familiarity Our aim was to isolate the crowd effect using a natural experiment created by the Coronavirus disease COVID pandemic which eliminated crowds in of NBA regular season games i N i Using mixed linear models we show in games with crowds home teams won of games and on average outrebounded and outscored their opponents This was a significant improvement compared to games without crowds of which home teams won of games and on average failed to outrebound or outscore their opponents Further the crowd related increase in rebound differential mediated the relationship between crowds and points differential Taken together these results suggest home advantage in the NBA season was predominately driven by the presence of home crowds and their influence on the effort exerted to rebound the basketball These findings are of considerable significance to a league where marginal gains can have immense competitive financial and historic consequences

Hong Kong s Covid epidemic circumstances have given us a valuable opportunity to reflect on Hong Kong s elderly care policies This essay argues that Hong Kong should learn from the West and provide a subsidy to family caregivers for proper elderly care We rebut the social and moralistic reasons for not introducing such a subsidy in Hong Kong We indicate that providing cash subsidy to family caregivers does not monetize or tarnish Confucian filial obligation to take care of elderly people but enable adult children from low income families to undertake this obligation effectively In addition we contend that providing such a subsidy would not significantly affect the job market in Hong Kong and that incurred financial and manpower costs for monitoring family care are controllable
Human cytomegalovirus CMV is a widespread persistent herpes virus requiring lifelong immune surveillance to maintain latency Such long term interactions with the immune system may be associated with deleterious effects including immune exhaustion and senescence Regarding the COVID pandemic we asked whether CMV specific cellular and humoral activity could influence immune responses toward SARS CoV and or disease severity All adults with mild n and severe n COVID were seropositive for anti CMV IgG but negative for IgM antibodies Antibody titers did not correlate with COVID severity Six patients presented elevated frequencies of CMV specific CD and CD T cells producing IFNγ IL and TNFα designated as CMV high responders hiT CMV In comparison to low CMV responders hiT CMV individuals exhibited higher frequencies of SARS CoV specific CD IL and CD IFNγ IL or TNFα T cells These results indicate that high frequencies of CMV specific T cells may be associated with a SARS CoV reactive profile skewed toward Th dominated immunity
Presence of suspended particulate matter SPM in a waterbody or a river can be caused by multiple parameters such as other pollutants by the discharge of poorly maintained sewage siltation sedimentation flood and even bacteria In this study remote sensing techniques were used to understand the effects of pandemic induced lockdown on the SPM concentration in the lower Tapi reservoir or Ukai reservoir The estimation was done using Landsat OLI Operational Land Imager having radiometric resolution bit and a spatial resolution of m The Google Earth Engine GEE cloud computing platform was used in this study to generate the products The GEE is a semi automated workflow system using a robust approach designed for scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets An algorithm was deployed and a time series analysis was done for the study area It was found that the average mean value of SPM in Tapi River during is lowest than the last seven years at the same time

Due to the coronavirus pandemic international conflicts dramatic changes of daily living have been enforced including new ways of providing patient assistance based on artificial intelligence The influence of these changes on people s mental health is still insufficiently analyzed and explored Chatbots like Woebot Wysa and Tess are gaining popularity being attractive and easy to use These achievements led us to develop a new application being still in the testing phase which has a positive impact on mental healthcare issues It is a conversational system capable to diagnose people s negative depressive and anxious emotions during chatting and to act as a psychological therapist and virtual friend The proposed system throughout the conversation succeeds to decrease the patient s insecurity sentiments by comforting their mood In fact an intelligent assistant for different mental health issues like stress anxiety and depression could become a very helpful information system
Remdesivir is an antiviral agent used as supportive care in adults with SARS COV induced pneumonia We report a case of an year old patient who developed hepatocellular acute liver injury hours after initiating remdesivir During the investigation other causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded A decrease in transaminases and international normalized ratio INR was observed hours after cessation of remdesivir An abdominal CT demonstrated hepatic congestion retrograde hepatic venous opacification shortly after intravenous contrast injection and dilatation of hepatic veins and inferior vena cava We suggest congestive hepatopathy secondary to remdesivir as a possible component of liver injury
Animals and viruses have constantly been co evolving under natural circumstances and pandemic like situations They harbour harmful viruses which can spread easily In the recent times we have seen pandemic like situations being created as a result of the spread of deadly and fatal viruses Coronaviruses CoVs are one of the wellrecognized groups of viruses There are four known genera of Coronavirus family namely alpha α beta β gamma γ and delta δ Animals have been infected with CoVs belonging to all four genera In the last few decades the world has witnessed an emergence of severe acute respiratory syndromes which had created a pandemic like situation such as SARS CoV MERS CoV We are currently in another pandemic like situation created due to the uncontrolled spread of a similar coronavirus namely SARSCoV These findings are based on a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can transmit disease to humans Several mammals including cats dogs bank voles ferrets fruit bats hamsters mink pigs rabbits racoon dogs and white tailed deer have been found to be infected naturally by the virus Certain laboratory discoveries revealed that animals such as cats ferrets fruit bats hamsters racoon dogs and white tailed deer can spread the illness to other animals of the same species This review article gives insights on the current knowledge about SARS CoV infection and development in animals on the farm and in domestic community and their impact on society
Alkaline phosphatase ALP induced i in situ i fluorescent immunosensor is less investigated and reported Herein a high performance ALP labeled i in situ i fluorescent immunoassay platform was constructed The developed platform was based on a fluorogenic self assembly reaction between pyridineboronic acid PyB OH sub sub and alizarin red S ARS We first used density functional theory DFT to theoretically calculate the changes of Gibbs free energy of the used chemicals before and after the combination and simulated the electrostatic potential on its surfaces The free ARS and PyB OH sub sub exist alone neither emits no fluorescence However the ARS PyB OH sub sub complex emits strong fluorescence which could be effectively quenched by PPi based on the stronger affinity between PPi and PyB OH sub sub than that of ARS and PyB OH sub sub PyB OH sub sub coordinated with ARS again in the presence of ALP due to the ALP catalyzed hydrolysis of PPi and correspondingly the fluorescence was restored We chose cTnI and SARS CoV N protein as the model antigen to construct ALP induced immunosensor which exhibited a wide dynamic range of ng mL for cTnI and SARS CoV N protein with a low limit of detection LOD of ng mL and ng mL respectively Moreover the proposed immunosensor was used to evaluate cTnI and SARS CoV N protein level in serum with satisfactory results Consequently the method laid the foundation for developing novel fluorescence based ALP labeled ELISA technologies in the early diagnosis of diseases
Neutralizing antibodies NAbs hold great promise for clinical interventions against SARS CoV variants of concern VOCs Understanding NAb epitope dependent antiviral mechanisms is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics against VOCs Here we characterized two potent NAbs EH and EH isolated from an unvaccinated pediatric patient with exceptional plasma neutralization activity EH and EH cross neutralize the early VOCs and mediate strong Fc dependent effector activity i in vitro i Structural analyses of EH and EH in complex with the receptor binding domain RBD revealed the molecular determinants of the epitope driven protection and VOC evasion While EH represents the prevalent IGHV NAb whose epitope substantially overlaps with the ACE binding site EH recognizes a narrow epitope exposed in both RBD up and RBD down conformations When tested i in vivo i a single dose prophylactic administration of EH fully protected stringent K hACE mice from lethal challenge with Delta VOC Our study demonstrates that protective NAbs responses converge in pediatric and adult SARS CoV patients
Proteases are major drug targets for many viral diseases However mutations can render several antiprotease drugs inefficient rapidly even though these mutations may not alter protein structures significantly Understanding relations between quickly mutating residues protease structures and the dynamics of the proteases is crucial for designing potent drugs Due to this reason we studied relations between the evolutionary information on residues in the amino acid sequences and protein dynamics for SARS CoV main protease More precisely we analyzed three dynamical quantities Schlitter entropy root mean square fluctuations and dynamical flexibility index and their relation to the amino acid conservation extracted from multiple sequence alignments of the main protease We showed that a quantifiable similarity can be built between a sequence based quantity called Jensen Shannon conservation and those three dynamical quantities We validated this similarity for a diverse set of different proteins other than the SARS CoV main protease We believe that establishing these kinds of quantitative bridges will have larger implications for all viral proteases as well as all proteins
Serology testing can identify past infection by quantifying the immune response of an infected individual providing important public health guidance Individual immune responses are time dependent which is reflected in antibody measurements Moreover the probability of obtaining a particular measurement from a random sample changes due to changing prevalence i e seroprevalence or fraction of individuals exhibiting an immune response of the disease in the population Taking into account these personal and population level effects we develop a mathematical model that suggests a natural adaptive scheme for estimating prevalence as a function of time We then combine the estimated prevalence with optimal decision theory to develop a time dependent probabilistic classification scheme that minimizes the error associated with classifying a value as positive history of infection or negative no such history on a given day since the start of the pandemic We validate this analysis by using a combination of real world and synthetic SARS CoV data and discuss the type of longitudinal studies needed to execute this scheme in real world settings

Due to the continued emergence of SARS CoV variants there has been considerable interest in how to display multivalent antigens efficiently Bacterial outer membrane vesicles OMVs can serve as an attractive vaccine delivery system because of their self adjuvant properties and the ability to be decorated with antigens Here we set up a bivalent antigen display platform based on engineered OMVs using mCherry and GFP and demonstrated that two different antigens of SARS CoV could be presented simultaneously in the lumen and on the surface of OMVs Comparing immunogenicity ClyA NG fusion and the receptor binding domain RBD of the spike protein in the OMV lumen elicited a stronger humoral response in mice than OMVs presenting either the ClyA NG fusion or RBD alone Taken together we provided an efficient approach to display SARS CoV antigens in the lumen and on the surface of the same OMV and highlighted the potential of OMVs as general multi antigen carriers
Right from the start of the COVID pandemic in January the entire tourism sector was put under immense pressure because of its assumed role in SARS CoV transmission and infection dynamics Based on reports of single superspreading events in the early days of the pandemic the hotel industry appeared in a bad light that impaired a strategic risk assessment of existing transmission risks between tourists and employees We prospectively analysed samples of employees of hotels and restaurants from July to December a time during which more than million tourists visited the Lübeck Ostholstein Baltic Sea vacation area in Northern Germany Employees were tested up to three times for an acute SARS CoV infection PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs and the presence of SARS CoV specific antibodies and were asked to complete a short questionnaire Despite the massive increase in tourist influx no significant increase in SARS CoV cases was observed amongst employees of the tourism sector from July to September In a cluster outbreak analysis of study participants of one single hotel in the Lübeck Ostholstein region in October being employed in the low wage sector housekeeping could be determined as major risk factor for becoming infected In conclusion in a low incidence setting touristic activities are safe under COVID related hygiene measures for both the local population and employees of the tourism sector Whereas the field of work is a potential risk factor for increased infection dynamics
Vaccines are undoubtedly the most effective means of combating viral diseases like COVID However there are risks associated with vaccination such as incomplete viral deactivation or potential adverse effects in humans However designing and developing a panel of new drug molecules is always encouraged In an emergency drug repurposing research is one of the most potent and rapid options RdRp RNA dependent RNA polymerase has been discovered to play a pivotal role in viral replication In this study FDA approved drugs bexarotene diiodohydroxyquinoline abiraterone cetilistat and remdesivir were repurposed against the RdRp by molecular modeling docking and dynamic simulation Furthermore to validate the potency of these drugs we compared them to the antiviral remdesivir which inhibits RdRp Our finding indicated that the selected drugs have a high potential to be developed as RdRp inhibitors and with further validation studies could serve as potential drugs for the treatment of COVID

The recent global Omicron epidemics underscore the great need for the development of small molecule therapeutics with appropriate mechanisms The trimeric spike protein S of SARS CoV plays a pivotal role in mediating viral entry into host cells We continued our efforts to develop small molecule SARS CoV entry inhibitors In this work two sets of BA derivatives were designed and synthesized based on the hit BA that was identified as a novel SARS CoV entry inhibitor Compound BA the most potent one showed broad inhibitory activities against pOmicron and other pseudotyped variants with EC sub sub values ranging to μM Moreover pSARS CoV assay SPR analysis Co IP assay and the cell cell fusion assay coupled with docking and mutagenesis studies revealed that BA could stabilize S in the pre fusion step to interfere with the membrane fusion thereby displaying promising inhibition against Omicron entry
A detailed understanding of protective immunity against SARS CoV is incredibly important in fighting the pandemic Central to protective immunity is the ability of the immune system to recall previous exposures Although antibody and T cell immunity have gained considerable attention the contribution of the NK cell compartment to immune recall and protection from SARS CoV has not been explored In this study we investigate the NK cell responses to stimulation with SARS CoV in previously exposed and non exposed individuals We show that NK cells demonstrate an enhanced CD T cell dependent response when re exposed to SARS CoV antigen The enhanced response is dependent on T cells and correlates with the number of SARS CoV specific CD T cells We find that IL is a critical mediator of NK cell function These findings suggest that NK cells contribute to the protective responses against SARS CoV through a cooperation with antigen specific CD T cells and have significant implications on our understanding of protective immunity in SARS CoV
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV the causative agent of the global coronavirus disease COVID pandemic contains a unique four amino acid aa PRRA insertion in the spike S protein that creates a transmembrane protease serine TMPRSS furin cleavage site and enhances viral infectivity More research into immunogenic epitopes and protective antibodies against this SARS CoV furin cleavage site is needed
With higher demands for food packaging and the development of nanotechnology nanopackaging is becoming a research hotspot in the field of food packaging because of its superb preservation effect and it can effectively resist oxidation and regulates energy metabolism to maintain the quality and prolong the shelf life of mushrooms Furthermore under the background of SARS CoV pandemic nanomaterials could be a potential tool to prevent virus transmission because of their excellent antiviral activities However the investigation and application of nanopackaging are facing many challenges including costs environmental pollution poor in depth genetic research for mechanisms and so on This article reviews the preservation effect and mechanisms of nanopackaging on the quality of mushrooms and discusses the trends and challenges of using these materials in food packaging technologies with the focus on nanotechnology and based on recent studies
Neutrophil and airway epithelial cell interactions are critical in the inflammatory response to viral infections including respiratory syncytial virus Sendai virus and SARS CoV Airway epithelial cell dysfunction during viral infections is likely mediated by the interaction of virus and recruited neutrophils at the airway epithelial barrier Neutrophils are key early responders to viral infection Neutrophil myeloperoxidase catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to hypochlorous acid HOCl Previous studies have shown HOCl targets host neutrophil and endothelial cell plasmalogen lipids resulting in the production of the chlorinated lipid chlorofatty aldehyde ClFALD We have previously shown that the oxidation product of ClFALD chlorofatty acid ClFA is present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of Sendai virus infected mice which likely results from the attack of the epithelial plasmalogen by neutrophil derived HOCl Herein we demonstrate small airway epithelial cells contain plasmalogens enriched with oleic acid at the sn position unlike endothelial cells which contain arachidonic acid enrichment at the sn position of plasmalogen We also show neutrophil derived HOCl targets epithelial cell plasmalogens to produce ClFALD Further proteomics and over representation analysis using the ω alkyne analog of the ClFALD molecular species chlorohexadecanal ClHDyA showed cell adhesion molecule binding and cell cell junction enriched categories similar to that observed previously in endothelial cells However in contrast to endothelial cells proteins in distinct metabolic pathways were enriched with ClFALD modification particularly pyruvate metabolism was enriched in epithelial cells and mitochondrial pyruvate respiration was reduced Collectively these studies demonstrate for the first time a novel plasmalogen molecular species distribution in airway epithelial cells that are targeted by myeloperoxidase derived hypochlorous acid resulting in electrophilic ClFALD which potentially modifies epithelial physiology by modifying proteins
Cytokine release syndrome also called cytokine storm could cause lung tissue damage acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and even death during SARS CoV infection However the underlying mechanisms of cytokine storm still remain unknown Among these cytokines the function of TNF α and type I IFNs especially deserved further investigation Here we first found that TNF α and IFN β synergistically induced human airway epithelial cells BEAS B death Mechanistically the combination of TNF α and IFN β led to the activation of caspase and caspase which initiated BEAS B apoptosis The activated caspase and caspase could further induce the cleavage and activation of gasdermin D GSDMD and gasdermin E GSDME which finally resulted in pro inflammatory pyroptosis The knock down of caspase and caspase could effectively block the activation of GSDMD and GSDME and then the death of BEAS B induced by TNF α and IFN β In addition pan caspase inhibitor Z VAD FMK ZVAD and necrosulfonamide NSA could inhibit BEAS B death induced by TNF α and IFN β Overall our work revealed one possible mechanism that cytokine storm causes airway epithelial cells AECs damage and ARDS These results indicated that blocking TNF α and IFN β mediated AECs death may be a potential target to treat related viral infectious diseases such as COVID

Following the recent COVID pandemic returning to normalcy has become the primary goal of global cities The key for returning to normalcy is to avoid affecting social and economic activities while supporting precise epidemic control Estimation models for the spatiotemporal spread of the epidemic at the refined scale of cities that support precise epidemic control are limited For most of Hong Kong has remained at the top of the global normalcy index because of its effective responses The urban community scale spatiotemporal onset risk prediction model of COVID symptom has been used to assist in the precise epidemic control of Hong Kong
The emergence of new variants of SARS CoV necessitates unremitting efforts to discover novel therapeutic monoclonal antibodies mAbs Here we report an extremely potent mAb named P A that can neutralize all the circulating variants of concern VOCs with high efficiency including the highly transmissible Omicron The crystal structure of the P A Fab RBD complex revealed that the residues of the RBD that interact with P A are a part of the ACE receptor binding motif and are not mutated in any of the VOCs The pan coronavirus pseudotyped neutralization assay confirmed that the P A mAb is specific for SARS CoV and its VOCs Passive administration of P A to K hACE transgenic mice conferred protection both prophylactically and therapeutically against challenge with VOCs Overall our data shows that the P A mAb has immense therapeutic potential to neutralize the current circulating VOCs Due to the overlap between the P A epitope and ACE binding site on Spike RBD P A may also be highly effective against a number of future variants
The global effort to sequence millions of SARS CoV genomes has provided an unprecedented view of viral evolution Characterizing how selection acts on SARS CoV is critical to developing effective long lasting vaccines and other treatments but the scale and complexity of genomic surveillance data make rigorous analysis challenging To meet this challenge we develop Bayesian Viral Allele Selection BVAS a principled and scalable probabilistic method for inferring the genetic determinants of differential viral fitness and the relative growth rates of viral lineages including newly emergent lineages After demonstrating the accuracy and efficacy of our method through simulation we apply BVAS to million SARS CoV genomes We identify numerous mutations that increase fitness including previously identified mutations in the SARS CoV Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins as well as mutations in non structural proteins whose contribution to fitness is less well characterized In addition we extend our baseline model to identify mutations whose fitness exhibits strong dependence on vaccination status as well as pairwise interaction effects i e epistasis Strikingly both these analyses point to the pivotal role played by the N residue in the Spike protein Our method which couples Bayesian variable selection with a diffusion approximation in allele frequency space lays a foundation for identifying fitness associated mutations under the assumption that most alleles are neutral

While vaccines against COVID are being rolled out an ongoing need remains for therapies to treat patients who have symptomatic COVID before vaccination or in whom breakthrough infection develops Dexamethasone and interleukin inhibitors have been the mainstay of treatment for severe to critical COVID requiring hospitalisation However in the previous few months several therapies have been approved in the UK for hospitalised and non hospitalised patients with COVID In particular the development of neutralising monoclonal antibodies and novel antivirals represents a welcome expansion in the armamentarium against COVID not only therapeutically to reduce mortality but also because they can be used in mild or moderate disease to prevent hospitalisation This update is based on guidance from NHS England as well as the World Health Organization and provides practical support and guidance to all clinicians involved or interested in the management of COVID patients whether based in community outpatient or inpatient settings
Adjustment disorder AjD is a is a maladaptive emotional or behavioral reaction to a stressful event or change in a person s life Compared to other previously validated tools the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire IADQ stands out as one of the most reliable and handy one for AjD Since no homologous instrument exists now in this study we aimed to validate an Italian version of the IADQ
The evolving proportion of the population considered immunologically naive versus primed for more efficient immune memory response to SARS CoV has implications for risk assessment We sought to chronicle vaccine and infection induced seroprevalence across the first waves of the COVID pandemic in British Columbia Canada
The continued emergence of SARS CoV variants is one of several factors that may cause false negative viral PCR test results Such tests are also susceptible to false positive results due to trace contamination from high viral titer samples Host immune response markers provide an orthogonal indication of infection that can mitigate these concerns when combined with direct viral detection Here we leverage nasopharyngeal swab RNA seq data from patients with COVID other viral acute respiratory illnesses and nonviral conditions i n i to develop support vector machine classifiers that rely on a parsimonious gene host signature to diagnose COVID We find that optimal classifiers include an interferon stimulated gene that is strongly induced in COVID compared with nonviral conditions such as i IFI i and a second immune response gene that is more strongly induced in other viral infections such as i GBP i The i IFI i i GBP i classifier achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC greater than when evaluated on an independent RNA seq cohort i n i We further provide proof of concept demonstration that the classifier can be implemented in a clinically relevant RT qPCR assay Finally we show that its performance is robust across common SARS CoV variants and is unaffected by cross contamination demonstrating its utility for improved accuracy of COVID diagnostics b IMPORTANCE b In this work we study upper respiratory tract gene expression to develop and validate a gene host based COVID diagnostic classifier and then demonstrate its implementation in a clinically practical qPCR assay We find that the host classifier has utility for mitigating false negative results for example due to SARS CoV variants harboring mutations at primer target sites and for mitigating false positive viral PCR results due to laboratory cross contamination Both types of error carry serious consequences of either unrecognized viral transmission or unnecessary isolation and contact tracing This work is directly relevant to the ongoing COVID pandemic given the continued emergence of viral variants and the continued challenges of false positive PCR assays It also suggests the feasibility of pan respiratory virus host based diagnostics that would have value in congregate settings such as hospitals and nursing homes where unrecognized respiratory viral transmission is of particular concern
The whole genome sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV strains from nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in the Republic of Moldova in June to September were determined Little variability was observed in the early stages when mostly clade A was circulating followed by clade B Later multiple introductions of SARS CoV lineages B B and B were detected The B lineage became predominant between December and June followed by the Delta variant
After the rapid surge of a novel coronavirus SARS CoV in anti SARS CoV vaccines have been developed to prevent the development of critical forms of COVID leading to Intensive Care Unit ICU admission The possibility of ICU admission after the first cycle vaccination has been already reported however no data have been published regarding vaccinated patients with a booster dose This retrospective study describes the characteristics of critically ill patients after the implementation of the regional booster dose vaccination program in a southern region of Italy

The unprecedented COVID epidemic in the United States US and worldwide caused by a new type of coronavirus SARS CoV occurred mostly because of higher than expected transmission speed and degree of virulence compared with previous respiratory virus outbreaks especially earlier Coronaviruses with person to person transmission e g MERS SARS The epidemic s size and duration however are mostly a function of failure of public health systems to prevent control the epidemic In the US this failure was due to historical disinvestment in public health services key players equivocating on decisions and political interference in public health actions In this communication we present a summary of these failures discuss root causes and make recommendations for improvement with focus on public health decisions
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV infection and the associated coronavirus disease COVID which severely affect the respiratory system and several organs and tissues and may lead to death have shown how science can respond when challenged by a global emergency offering as a response a myriad of rapid technological developments Development of vaccines at lightning speed is one of them SARS CoV outbreaks have stressed healthcare systems questioning patients care by using standard non adapted therapies and diagnostic tools In this scenario nanotechnology has offered new tools techniques and opportunities for prevention for rapid accurate and sensitive diagnosis and treatment of COVID In this review we focus on the nanotechnological applications and nano based materials i e personal protective equipment to combat SARS CoV transmission infection organ damage and for the development of new tools for virosurveillance diagnose and immune protection by mRNA and other nano based vaccines All the nano based developed tools have allowed a historical unprecedented real time epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of SARS CoV infection at community and international levels The nano based technology has help to predict and detect how this Sarbecovirus is mutating and the severity of the associated COVID disease thereby assisting the administration and public health services to make decisions and measures for preparedness against the emerging variants of SARS CoV and severe or lethal COVID
Since two years ago the COVID virus has spread strongly in the world and has killed more than million people directly and has affected the lives of more than million people Early diagnosis of the virus can help to break the chain of transmission and reduce the death rate In most cases the virus spreads in the infected person s chest Therefore the analysis of a chest CT scan is one of the most efficient methods for diagnosing a patient Until now various methods have been presented to diagnose COVID disease in chest CT scan images Most recent studies have proposed deep learning based methods But handcrafted features provide acceptable results in some studies too In this paper an innovative approach is proposed based on the combination of low level and deep features First of all local neighborhood difference patterns are performed to extract handcrafted texture features Next deep features are extracted using MobileNetV Finally a two level decision making algorithm is performed to improve the detection rate especially when the proposed decisions based on the two different feature set are not the same The proposed approach is evaluated on a collected dataset of chest CT scan images from June to December of cases in two groups of patient and healthy in different COVID variants The results show that the combination of texture and deep features can provide better performance than using each feature set separately Results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides higher accuracy in comparison with some state of the art methods in this scope
To investigate Long COVID Syndrome LCS pathophysiology we performed an exploratory study with blood plasma derived from three groups healthy vaccinated individuals without SARS CoV exposure asymptomatic recovered patients at least three months after SARS CoV infection and symptomatic patients at least months after SARS CoV infection with chronic fatigue syndrome or similar symptoms here designated as Long COVID Syndrome LCS patients Multiplex cytokine profiling indicated slightly elevated pro inflammatory cytokine levels in recovered individuals in contrast to LCS patients Plasma proteomics demonstrated low levels of acute phase proteins and macrophage derived secreted proteins in LCS High levels of anti inflammatory oxylipins including omega fatty acids in LCS were detected by eicosadomics whereas targeted metabolic profiling indicated high levels of anti inflammatory osmolytes taurine and hypaphorine but low amino acid and triglyceride levels and deregulated acylcarnithines A model considering alternatively polarized macrophages as a major contributor for these molecular alterations is presented
Recent studies have revealed the unique virological characteristics of Omicron particularly those of its spike protein such as less cleavage efficacy in cells reduced ACE binding affinity and poor fusogenicity However it remains unclear which mutation s determine these three virological characteristics of Omicron spike Here we show that these characteristics of the Omicron spike protein are determined by its receptor binding domain Interestingly molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that acquisition of the spike S F mutation was closely associated with the explosive spread of Omicron in the human population We further elucidated that the F residue forms an interprotomer pi pi interaction with the H residue of another protomer in the spike trimer conferring the attenuated cleavage efficiency and fusogenicity of Omicron spike Our data shed light on the evolutionary events underlying the emergence of Omicron at the molecular level
The emergence of novel SARS CoV variants led to the recommendation of booster vaccinations after Ad COV S priming It was previously shown that heterologous booster vaccination induces high antibody levels but how heterologous boosters affect other functional aspects of the immune response remained unknown Here we performed immunological profiling of Ad COV S primed individuals before and after homologous or heterologous mRNA or BNT b booster Booster vaccinations increased functional antibodies targeting ancestral SARS CoV and emerging variants Especially heterologous booster vaccinations induced high levels of functional antibodies In contrast T cell responses were similar in magnitude following homologous or heterologous booster vaccination and retained cross reactivity towards variants Booster vaccination led to a minimal expansion of SARS CoV specific T cell clones and no increase in breadth of the T cell repertoire In conclusion we show that Ad COV S priming vaccination provided a solid immunological base for heterologous boosting increasing humoral and cellular responses targeting emerging variants of concern
Patients with severe COVID exhibit a cytokine storm characterized by greatly elevated levels of cytokines Despite this the interferon IFN response is delayed contributing to disease progression Here we report that SARS CoV excessively generates small viral RNAs svRNAs encoding exact ends of positive sense genes in human cells i in vitro i and i ex vivo i whereas endemic human coronaviruses OC and E produce significantly fewer similar svRNAs SARS CoV end svRNAs are RIG I agonists and induce the IFN β response in later stages of infection The first nt ends bearing duplex structures and triphosphates are responsible for immune stimulation We propose that RIG I activation by accumulated SARS CoV end svRNAs may contribute to later drive over exuberant IFN production Additionally the differences in the amounts of svRNAs produced and the corresponding IFN response among CoV strains suggest that lower svRNA production during replication may correlate with the weaker immune response seen in less pathogenic CoVs
Memory B cells MBCs generate rapid antibody responses upon secondary encounter with a pathogen Here we investigated the kinetics avidity and cross reactivity of serum antibodies and MBCs in SARS CoV infected and vaccinated individuals over a month timeframe SARS CoV specific MBCs and serum antibodies reached steady state titers with comparable kinetics in infected and vaccinated individuals Whereas MBCs of infected individuals targeted both pre and postfusion Spike S most vaccine elicited MBCs were specific for prefusion S consistent with the use of prefusion stabilized S in mRNA vaccines Furthermore a large fraction of MBCs recognizing postfusion S cross reacted with human betacoronaviruses The avidity of MBC derived and serum antibodies increased over time resulting in enhanced resilience to viral escape by SARS CoV variants including Omicron BA and BA sub lineages albeit only partially for BA and BA sublineages Overall the maturation of high affinity and broadly reactive MBCs provides the basis for effective recall responses to future SARS CoV variants

During the first half of the World Health Organization reported an outbreak of acute severe hepatitis of unknown aetiology AS Hep UA in children following initial alerts from the United Kingdom UK where a cluster of cases was first observed in previously well children aged years Sporadic cases were then reported across Europe and worldwide although in most countries incidence did not increase above the expected baseline There were no consistent epidemiological links between cases and microbiological investigations ruled out known infectious causes of hepatitis In this review we explore the evidence for the role of viral infection superimposed on a specific host genetic background as a trigger for liver pathology This hypothesis is based on a high prevalence of Human Adenovirus HAdV F in affected children together with metagenomic evidence of adeno associated virus Adeno associated viruses which is a putative trigger for an immune mediated liver injury Roles for superantigen mediated pathology have also been explored with a focus on the potential contribution of SARS CoV infection Affected children also had a high frequency of the MHC allele HLA DRB supporting an immunological predisposition and may have been vulnerable to viral coinfections due to disruption in normal patterns of exposure and immunity as a result of population lockdowns during the COVID pandemic We discuss areas of ongoing uncertainty and highlight the need for ongoing scrutiny to inform clinical and public health interventions for this outbreak and for others that may evolve in future
b Introduction b Drug related problems DRP are events or circumstances in which drug therapy does or could interfere with desired health outcomes In December a new coronavirus SARS CoV appeared Little knowledge about this type of infection resulted in the administration of various drugs with limited use in other pathologies Evidence about DRP in patients with COVID is lacking b Objective b The aim of the present study is to describe identified cases of DRP and those drugs involved in the first wave of patients with COVID and evaluate associated risk factors b Material and methods b Observational retrospective study performed in a tertiary university hospital between th March and May corresponding to the first COVID wave We recruited patients admitted during the study period Exclusion criteria included age years admission to critically ill units and care received either in the emergency room at home hospitalization or a healthcare center b Results b A total of patients were included The mean age was years SD range and were male A total of DRP were detected Among the patients presented at least one DRP The mean DRP per patient with an identified case was The prevailing DRPs among those observed were incorrect dosage over or underdosage in patients wrong drug combination in prescriptions not in adherence to the then COVID treatment protocol in prescription errors due to the wrong use of the computerized physician order entry in and incorrect dosage due to renal function in The logistic regression analysis showed that patients who received only prescriptions of antibacterials for systemic use J ATC group faced a higher likelihood of experiencing a DRP OR i p i b Conclusion b We identified several factors associated with an increased risk of DRPs similar to those reported in other pre pandemic studies including a prolonged length of stay higher number of prescribed drugs and antimicrobial administration The relevance of pharmacists and tools like pharmacy warning systems can help prevent identify and resolve DRP efficiently
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus SARS CoV infects both people and animals and may cause significant respiratory problems including lung illness Corona Virus Disease COVID Swabs taken from the throat and nose of people who have the illness or are suspected of having it have shown this pathogenic virus When SARS CoV infects the upper and lower respiratory tracts it may induce moderate to severe respiratory symptoms as well as the release of pro inflammatory cytokines including interleukin IL COVID induced reduction of IL in an inflammatory state may have a hitherto undiscovered therapeutic impact Many inflammatory disorders including viral infections has been found to be regulated by IL In individuals with COVID one of the primary inflammatory agents that causes inflammatory storm is IL It promotes the inflammatory response of virus infection including the virus infection caused by SARS CoV and provides a new diagnostic and therapeutic strategy In this review article we highlighted the functions of IL in the coronavirus especially in COVID showing that IL activation plays an important function in the progression of coronavirus and is a rational therapeutic goal for inflammation aimed at coronavirus
Patients with frailty are considered to be at greater risk to get severe infection from SARS CoV One of the most effective strategies is vaccination In our study we evaluated both the humoral immune response elicited by the vaccination at different time points and the i T i cell response in terms of interferon IFN γ production in frail patients and healthy donors Fifty seven patients patients undergoing hemodialysis and HIV positive subjects and healthcare workers were enrolled All participants received two doses of the mRNA vaccine BNT b Healthcare workers showed a significantly higher antibody titer than patients twenty one days after the first dose p From the same time point we observed for both groups a decay of the antibody levels with a steeper slope of decline in the patients group Regarding i T i cell response the only significant difference between non reactive and reactive subjects was found in median antibody levels higher in the responders group than in non responders The healthcare workers seem to better respond to the vaccination in terms of antibodies production the lack of i T i cell response in about of the participants seems to suggest that in our study population both humoral and cell mediated response decline over time remarking the importance of the booster doses particularly for frail patients

Since December severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV has affected almost all countries The unprecedented spreading of this virus has led to the insurgence of many variants that impact protein sequence and structure that need continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences to understand the genetic evolution and to prevent possible dangerous outcomes Some variants causing the modification of the structure of the proteins such as the Spike protein S need to be monitored Protein contact networks PCNs have been recently proposed as a modelling framework for protein structures In such a framework the protein structure is represented as an unweighted graph whose nodes are the central atoms of the backbones C math xmlns http www w org Math MathML mi α mi math and edges connect two atoms falling in the spatial distance between and Å PCN may also be a data rich representation since we may add to each node atom biological and topological information Such formalism enables the possibility of using algorithms from graph theory to analyze the graph In particular we refer to graph embedding methods enabling the analysis of such graphs with deep learning methods In this work we explore the possibility of embedding PCN using Graph Neural Networks and then analyze in the embedded space each residue to distinguish mutated residues from non mutated ones In particular we analyzed the structure of the Spike protein of the coronavirus First we obtained the PCNs of the Spike protein for the wild type math xmlns http www w org Math MathML mi α mi math math xmlns http www w org Math MathML mi β mi math and math xmlns http www w org Math MathML mi δ mi math variants Then we used the GraphSage embedding algorithm to obtain an unsupervised embedding Then we analyzed the point of mutation in the embedded space Results show the characteristics of the mutation point in the embedding space
Great attempts have been done for the development of novel antiviral compounds against SAR CoV to end this pandemic situation and save human society Herewith we have synthesized substituted indole substituted pyrrole dihydropyridine and azaxanthone scaffolds using simple commercially available starting materials in a one pot green and regioselective manner Further the regioselectivity of product formation was confirmed by various studies such as controlled experiments density functional theory DFT Mulliken atomic charge and electrostatic potential ESP surface In addition substituted indole dihydropyridine was successfully converted into a biologically enriched pharmacophore scaffold i viz i indolylimidazopyridinylbenzofuran scaffold in excellent yield Moreover the synthesized substituted indole dihydropyridine substituted pyrroles were analyzed in docking studies for anti SARS CoV properties against their main protease M sup pro sup and anti Delta plus properties against their protein of the Delta plus K N mutant Further the drug likeness prediction was analyzed by the Lipinski rule and other pharmacokinetic properties like absorption distribution metabolism excretion and toxicity using preADMET prediction Interestingly the docking results show that out of synthesized compounds of them for M sup pro sup of SAR CoV and of them for NX spike glycoprotein s A chain of Delta plus K N show greater binding affinity when compared with remdesivir that is the first to receive FDA approval and is currently used as a potent drug for the treatment of COVID These results suggest that indole pyrrole substituted dihydropyridine derivatives are capable of combating SARS CoV and its Delta plus mutant
The ongoing SARS CoV COVID pandemic caused a global public health crisis Yet everyone s response to SARS CoV infection varies and different viral variants confer diverse pathogenicity Thus it is imperative to understand how viral determinants contribute to COVID Viral ORF a protein is one of those viral determinants as its functions are linked to induction of cell and tissues damages disease severity and cytokine storm that is a major cause of COVID related death ORF a is a membrane associated protein Upon synthesis it is transported from endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus to plasma membrane and subcellular endomembranes including endosomes and lysosomes However how ORF a is transported intracellularly remains elusive The goal of this study was to carry out a systematic mutagenesis study to determine the structural relationship of ORF a protein with its subcellular locations Single amino acid aa and deletion mutations were generated in the putative function relevant motifs and other regions of interest Immunofluorescence and ImageJ analyses were used to determine and quantitate subcellular locations of ORF a mutants in comparison with wildtype ORF a The wildtype ORF a localizes predominantly Pearson s coefficients about on the membranes of endosomes and lysosomes Consistent with earlier findings deletion of the YXXΦ motif which is required for protein export retained ORF a in the Golgi apparatus Interestingly mutations in a double glycine diG region aa displayed a similar phenotype to the YXXΦ deletion implicating a similar role of the diG motif in intracellular transport Indeed interrupting any one of the two glycine residues such as deletion of a single dG both dG dG or substitution G Y of these residues led to ORF a retention in the Golgi apparatus Pearson s coefficients Structural analyses further suggest that the diG motif supports a type II β turn between the anti parallel β and β sheets and connects to the YXXΦ motif i via i hydrogen bonds between two monomers The diG YXXΦ interaction forms a hand in hand configuration that could facilitate dimerization Together these observations suggest a functional role of the diG motif in intracellular transport of ORF a
Fructose rich beverages and foods consumption correlates with the epidemic rise in cardiovascular disease diabetes and obesity Severity of COVID has been related to these metabolic diseases Fructose rich foods could place people at an increased risk for severe COVID We investigated whether maternal fructose intake in offspring affects hepatic and ileal gene expression of proteins that permit SARS CoV entry to the cell Carbohydrates were supplied to pregnant rats in drinking water Adult and young male descendants subjected to water liquid fructose alone or as a part of a Western diet were studied Maternal fructose reduced hepatic SARS CoV entry factors expression in older offspring On the contrary maternal fructose boosted the Western diet induced increase in viral entry factors expression in ileum of young descendants Maternal fructose intake produced a fetal programming that increases hepatic viral protection and in contrast exacerbates fructose plus cholesterol induced diminution in SARS CoV protection in small intestine of progeny

Blood testis barrier is body s innate mechanism to defend germ cells by creating a physical and immunological barrier But some viral infections are known to evade it As ACE and TMPRSS are present all over the body including male reproductive tract it is worth exploring how coronavirus disease COVID could possibly affect male fertility A review of literature was done using search engines like PubMed Medline Google Scholar etc and all the latest articles up to May were considered Some studies have substantiated the presence of orchitis in COVID patients using semen and tissue samples Though most studies report the absence of virus in testis involvement of seminiferous tubules has been seen in pathological analysis suggesting defective spermatogenesis This can be primarily attributed to inflammation and increased vascular permeability Other factors that could affect male fertility are fever autoimmune response drugs and erectile dysfunction Male fertility is an important aspect of health care and must be looked into Further studies can be done to understand host immunity towards SARS CoV in the testis It will be worthwhile to know whether viral orchitis and its sequelae are acute or chronic in nature and if they are reversible Effect of the virus on female reproductive tract can also be assessed further Counselling can be given to affected recovering patients along with correct selection of drugs to prevent these long term complications
The COVID pandemic has led to the development and rollout of several vaccines worldwide at unprecedented pace This systematic review of published literature has been undertaken to spread awareness among general physicians and ophthalmologists about the various reported adverse effects in the eye following COVID vaccination A systematic search was performed on January through PuBMed Medline and Google scholar for publications on ocular adverse effects after COVID vaccination One brief communication four retrospective case series sixteen case reports and five letters to editors were included Ocular manifestations most commonly appear in the uvea and retina Other manifestations are seen on the eyelid cornea and ocular surface and in cranial nerves innervating the eye The incidence rate of these manifestations is quite low after COVID vaccinations Our systematic review meticulously enumerates various adverse effects of COVID vaccine on the eye Most of these adverse effects are transient and observed to resolve without any sequelae except for cases of retinal and ophthalmic vascular occlusions and corneal graft rejections An emphasis on close follow up and a need to delay vaccination and modified therapy to control flare up of signs and symptoms in certain sub populations Graves disease autoimmune etiology pre existing uveal inflammation and corneal graft cases are warranted We need long term larger multicentric studies to substantiate our findings and establish the causal relationship with certainty Mass vaccinations to curb this pandemic after outweighing the ocular risks associated with it is warranted

Coronavirus disease COVID has been a global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus strain with strong infectivity severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV With the in depth research the close relationship between COVID and immune system has been dug out During the infection macrophages dendritic cells natural killer cells CD sup sup T cells Th Th Tfh cells and effector B cells are all involved in the anti SARS CoV responses however the dysfunctional immune responses will ultimately lead to the excessive inflammation acute lung injury even other organ failure Thus a detailed understanding of pertinent immune response during COVID will provide insights in predicting disease outcomes and developing appropriate therapeutic approaches In this review we mainly clarify the role of immune cells in COVID and the target vaccine development and treatment
Vaccination is one of the most vigorous ways to intervene in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV pandemic Cases of autoimmune hepatitis AIH after coronavirus disease COVID vaccination have been increasingly reported Twenty seven cases of AIH are summarized in this study providing emerging evidence of autoimmune reactions in response to various COVID vaccines including in patients with special disease backgrounds such as primary sclerosing cholangitis PSC liver transplantation and previous hepatitis C virus HCV treatment Molecular mimicry adjuvants epitope spreading bystander activation X chromosome and sceptical hepatotropism of SARS CoV may account for to some extent such autoimmune phenomena Immunosuppressive corticosteroids perform well with or without azathioprine in such post COVID vaccination AIH However determination of the exact mechanism and establishment of causality require further confirmation
All currently approved COVID vaccines utilize the spike protein as their immunogen SARS CoV variants of concern VOCs contain mutations in the spike protein enabling them to escape infection and vaccination induced immune responses to cause reinfection New vaccines are hence being researched intensively Studying SARS CoV epitopes is essential for vaccine design as identifying targets of broadly neutralizing antibody responses and immunodominant T cell epitopes reveal candidates for inclusion in next generation COVID vaccines We summarize the major studies which have reported on SARS CoV antibody and T cell epitopes thus far These results suggest that a future of pan coronavirus vaccines which not only protect against SARS CoV but numerous other coronaviruses may be possible The T cell epitopes of SARS CoV have gotten less attention than neutralizing antibody epitopes but may provide new strategies to control SARS CoV infection T cells target many SARS CoV antigens other than spike recognizing numerous epitopes within these antigens thereby limiting the chance of immune escape by VOCs that mainly possess spike protein mutations Therefore augmenting vaccination induced T cell responses against SARS CoV may provide adequate protection despite broad antibody escape by VOCs
Immune responses to vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS coronavirus CoV are variable In the absence of disease youngsters are expected to better react to vaccines than adults Nevertheless chronic immunosuppression in transplant recipients may impair their capability to generate protection We aim to explore immune responses after BNT b SARS CoV vaccination in our cohort of young liver transplanted patients

Vaccines against SARS CoV have alleviated infection rates hospitalization and deaths associated with COVID In order to monitor humoral immunity several serology tests have been developed but the recent emergence of variants of concern has revealed the need for assays that predict the neutralizing capacity of antibodies in a fast and adaptable manner Sensitive and fast neutralization assays would allow a timely evaluation of immunity against emerging variants and support drug and vaccine discovery efforts Here we describe a simple fast and cell free multiplexed flow cytometry assay to interrogate the ability of antibodies to prevent the interaction of Angiotensin converting enzyme ACE and the receptor binding domain RBD of the original Wuhan SARS CoV strain and emerging variants simultaneously as a surrogate neutralization assay Using this method we demonstrate that serum antibodies collected from representative individuals at different time points during the pandemic present variable neutralizing activity against emerging variants such as Omicron BA and South African B Importantly antibodies present in samples collected during before the third dose of the vaccine was administered do not confer complete neutralization against Omicron BA as opposed to samples collected in which show significant neutralizing activity The proposed approach has a comparable performance to other established surrogate methods such as cell based assays using pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing the spike of SARS CoV as demonstrated by the assessment of the blocking activity of therapeutic antibodies i e Imdevimab and serum samples This method offers a scalable cost effective and adaptable platform for the dynamic evaluation of antibody protection in affected populations against variants of SARS CoV

The Covid pandemic caused by the Sars Cov virus created challenges and stimulated development of new forms of treatment in many different areas of medicine Studies have described the clinical characteristics of patients and their outcomes including disorders affecting the coagulation system in which patients infected by the virus enter a hypercoagulable and proinflammatory state that mimics vasculitis The objective of this study was to describe the clinical status and the treatment administered to three patients who developed acute arterial occlusion after Covid infection The management adopted in these cases enabled the patients to recover without sequelae The low incidence and scarcity of published reports make it difficult to establish universally accepted treatment criteria and options for cases of ischemia in patients infected with the novel coronavirus whether presenting early or late
To help inform post COVID pandemic practical health policies the researchers created the COVID vaccine misinformation scale CVMS During the COVID pandemic falsehoods spread online which casted doubt and concerns about the vaccine Example misconceptions included vaccination leads to greater vulnerability to other illness and would alter someone s DNA The researchers performed two large surveys with U S participants The researchers reviewed debunked COVID vaccine falsehoods online Construction of the CVMS followed standard psychometric scale development steps Statistical analysis provided support for the item CVMS with satisfactory reliability discriminant validity and convergent validity Predictive validity regression analysis demonstrated the CVMS associated with higher vaccine hesitancy The prevalence of vaccine misbeliefs broadened pandemic healthcare challenges On top of existing duties healthcare workers had to explain vaccine efficacy and safety to dispel fallacies The researchers discuss implications for the CVMS within the context of motivated reasoning theory
Background This study seeks to investigate the distribution of the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE gene polymorphism and serum levels in patients with viral pneumonia and predict which polymorphism will lead to severe progression of the disease Methodology The serum ACE levels and ACE gene polymorphisms were successfully evaluated with respect to subsequent viral pneumonia using records of patients with viral pneumonia and healthy controls Results ACE serum concentration was statistically significantly elevated ACE serum concentration with a cut off value of pg mL had sensitivity and selectivity In addition patients with ACE genotype D D were times more likely to manifest severe lung involvement than those with I I and patients with the I D genotype were times more likely than their counterparts with I I The computed tomography findings of the patients revealed that ACE serum concentration was significantly effective in discriminating between mild and moderate to severe lung involvement No significant difference was observed between the blood parameters and ACE genotype distributions Conclusions I D polymorphism likely affects the expression of the ACE gene and or the function of the angiotensin I converting enzyme The D D genotype is associated with vessel wall thickness and higher blood pressure Strong evidence was found between D D and I D genotypes in the patient cohort concerning genotypes and ACE serum concentration Further analysis showed that ACE serum levels were more elevated in the D D genotype compared to the I D genotype in the patient cohort
Variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus frequently arise within infected individuals Here we explored the level and pattern of intra host viral diversity in association with disease severity Then we analyzed information underlying these nucleotide changes to infer the impetus including mutational signatures and immune selection from neutralizing antibody or T cell recognition From January to March a set of cross sectional samples were collected from individuals with homogeneous founder virus regardless of disease severity Intra host single nucleotide variants iSNVs were enumerated using deep sequencing Human leukocyte antigen HLA alleles were genotyped by Sanger sequencing Medical records were collected and reviewed by attending physicians A total of iSNVs per sample were identified and distributed in a highly individualized pattern The number of iSNVs paced with infection duration peaked within days and declined thereafter These iSNVs did not stochastically arise due to a strong bias toward C U G A and U C A G substitutions in reciprocal proportion with escalating disease severity Eight nonsynonymous iSNVs in the receptor binding domain could escape from neutralization and eighteen iSNVs were significantly associated with specific HLA alleles The level and pattern of iSNVs reflect the i in vivo i viral host interaction and the disease pathogenesis
Aptamers have been selected with strong affinity and high selectivity for a wide range of targets as recently highlighted by the development of aptamer based sensors that can differentiate infectious from non infectious viruses including human adenovirus and SARS CoV Accurate determination of the binding affinity between the DNA aptamers and their viral targets is the first step to understanding the molecular recognition of viral particles and the potential uses of aptamers in various diagnostics and therapeutic applications Here we describe protocols to obtain the binding curve of the DNA aptamers to SARS CoV using Enzyme Linked Oligonucleotide Assay ELONA and MicroScale Thermophoresis MST These methods allow for the determination of the binding affinity of the aptamer to the infectious SARS CoV and the selectivity of this aptamer against the same SARS CoV that has been rendered non infectious by UV inactivation and other viruses Compared to other techniques like Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay EMSA Surface Plasmon Resonance SPR and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry ITC these methods have advantages for working with larger particles like viruses and with samples that require biosafety level facilities
The novel coronavirus COVID has become a cause for global concern Apart from a multitude of symptoms the virus is known for its ability to cause loss of taste and smell that can be irreversible in a few cases In fact even after recovery post covid syndrome can still lead to devastating outcomes specifically with reference to loss of smell and taste A number of mechanisms that have been postulated include receptor mediated uptake increased inflammation transneuronal migration and direct damage to the olfactory pathway Considering how important these two senses are many psychological social and emotional repercussions can be expected These repercussions include lowering of self esteem and developmental of mental health issues Long term altered taste sensation can also lead to the development of unhealthy eating habits that can result in increasing risk for diabetes and hypertension A few solutions have been investigated for treating these chemosensory dysfunctions such as olfactory training corticosteroids theophylline and acupuncture Although the results have been promising but a new modality virtual reality requires more in depth exploration because it targets not only the dysfunction but also the mental health issues being experienced It is important that affected individuals be provided with strong emotional and family support Additionally physicians can help the patients through support groups cognitive behavioural therapy olfactory and virtual reality training

Breakthrough SARS CoV infections have been reported in fully vaccinated individuals in spite of the high efficacy of the currently available vaccines proven in trials and real world studies Several variants of concern VOC have been proffered to be associated with breakthrough infections following immunization In this study we investigated breakthrough infections recorded between January and July and compared the distribution of SARS CoV genotypes identified in fully vaccinated individuals to the frequency of circulating community lineages in the region of South Limburg The Netherlands in a week by week comparison Although the proportion of breakthrough infections was relatively low and stable when the Alpha variant was predominant the rapid emergence of the Delta variant lead to a strong increase in breakthrough infections with a higher relative proportion of individuals vaccinated with Vaxzevria or Jcovden being infected compared to those immunized with mRNA based vaccines A significant difference in median age was observed when comparing fully vaccinated individuals with severe symptoms years to asymptomatic cases years or individuals with mild to moderate symptoms years There was no association between SARS CoV genotype or vaccine type and disease symptoms Furthermore the majority of adaptive mutations were concentrated in the N terminal domain of the Spike protein highlighting its role in immune evasion Interestingly symptomatic individuals harbored significantly higher SARS CoV loads than asymptomatic vaccinated individuals and breakthrough infections caused by the Delta variant were associated with increased viral loads compared to those caused by the Alpha variant In addition we investigated the role of the Omicron variant in causing breakthrough infections by analyzing samples that were randomly selected for genomic surveillance during the transition period from Delta to Omicron We found that the proportion of Omicron vs Delta infections was significantly higher in individuals who received a booster vaccine compared to both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals Altogether these results indicate that the emergence of the Delta variant and in particular Omicron has lowered the efficiency of particular vaccine types to prevent SARS CoV infections and that although rare the elderly are particularly at risk of becoming severely infected as the consequence of a breakthrough infection
Viral infections are the culprit of many diseases including inflammation of the heart muscle known as myocarditis Acute myocarditis cases have been described in scientific literature and viruses such as parvovirus B coxsackievirus B or more recently SARS CoV were the direct cause of cardiac inflammation If not treated myocarditis could progress to dilated cardiomyopathy which permanently impairs the heart and limits a person s lifespan Accumulated evidence suggests that certain viruses may persist in cardiac tissue after the initial infection which could open up the door to reactivation under favorable conditions Whether this chronic infection contributes to or initiates cardiac damage over time remains a pressing issue in the field of virus induced heart pathology and it is directly tied to patients treatment Previously large case studies found that a few viruses parvovirus B coxsackievirus adenovirus human herpesvirus cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus are most commonly found in human endomyocardial biopsy samples derived from patients experiencing cardiac inflammation or dilated cardiomyopathy SARS CoV infection has also been shown to have cardiovascular consequences This review examines the role of viral persistence in cardiac inflammation and heart disease and discusses its implications for patients outcomes

The highly contagious SARS COV virus spread rapidly from China and formed a global pandemic The virus has infected over million people worldwide and killed about million up to date Up on invasion the Receptor Binding Domain RBD of Spike protein plays a crucial role in the entry of the virus into the host cell The virus N protein is another protein that has a critical role for genome packaging
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV is the pathogen responsible for pandemic coronavirus disease COVID It is a highly contagious virus which primarily affects the respiratory tract nevertheless the lungs are not the only target organs of the virus The intestinal tract could represent an additional tropism site for SARS CoV Several observations have collectively suggested that enteric infections can occur in COVID patients However the detection of viral RNA in gastrointestinal GI tissue samples has not been adequately investigated and results are conflicting
Antibiotic resistance is a global public health threat and urgent actions should be undertaken for developing alternative antimicrobial strategies and approaches Notably bismuth drugs exhibit potent antimicrobial effects on various pathogens and promising efficacy in tackling SARS CoV and related infections As such bismuth based materials could precisely combat pathogenic bacteria and effectively treat the resultant infections and inflammatory diseases through a controlled release of Bi ions for targeted drug delivery Currently it is a great challenge to rapidly and massively manufacture bismuth based particles and yet there are no reports on effectively constructing such porous antimicrobial loaded particles Herein we have developed two rapid approaches i i e i ultrasound assisted and agitation free methods to synthesizing bismuth based materials with ellipsoid Ellipsoids and rod like Rods morphologies respectively and fully characterized physicochemical properties Rods with a porous structure were confirmed as bismuth metal organic frameworks Bi MOF and aligned with the crystalline structure of CAU Importantly the formation of Rods was a two step crystallization process of growing almond flake like units followed by stacking into the rod like structure The size of Bi MOF was precisely controlled from micro to nano scales by varying concentrations of metal ions and their ratio to the ligand Moreover both Ellipsoids and Rods showed excellent biocompatibility with human gingival fibroblasts and potent antimicrobial effects on the Gram negative oral pathogens including i Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans i i Porphyromonas gingivalis i and i Fusobacterium nucleatum i Both Ellipsoids and Rods at μg mL could disrupt the bacterial membranes and particularly eliminate i P gingivalis i biofilms This study demonstrates highly efficient and facile approaches to synthesizing bismuth based particles Our work could enrich the administration modalities of metallic drugs for promising antibiotic free healthcare
Louis Pasteur made seminal discoveries in microbiology immunology and vaccinology that transformed clinical science and saved millions of lives Since the th century our ability to study infectious disease has undergone radical changes due to newly emerging technologies and infection models In this Editorial I consider Pasteur s impact on our ability to understand and combat infectious disease in the context of two modern day pandemics coronavirus disease COVID and antimicrobial resistance AMR During the COVID pandemic we witnessed remarkable ambition to understand severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV infection and to innovate effective vaccines to prevent disease For the comparatively overlooked pandemic of AMR we require the same level of urgency to develop alternative approaches to combat antibiotic resistant bacterial strains that cause millions of deaths annually Pasteur s statement chance only favours the mind which is prepared is a principle that captures l esprit Pasteur This principle should continue to guide modern day research on infectious disease and for this we need to support the development of predictive disease models and cutting edge mechanistic research that prepare us for discovery and therapeutic impact

COVID is a systemic disease with multiorgan damage which requires a better understanding and deepening of histopathogenesis in order to improve treatment Autopsy remains a gold standard to establish certain diagnoses and to integrate the morphological spectrum of lung lesions explaining the cause of death into a clinical context
The different viral characteristics of the Omicron variant of SARS CoV have fundamentally changed people s view concerning COVID Many alternative sampling approaches and therapies have been developed that may be better suited to the Omicron variant such as a saline gargle to detect SARS CoV and nasal irrigation with chlorine dioxide The mechanisms of these methods of sampling and alternative therapies are briefly summarized here Development of novel alternative sampling therapeutic approaches for COVID is crucial due to the uncertain future of emerging respiratory viruses and their efficiency safety needs to be verified in a post pandemic era since viral infections of the respiratory tract have a similar route of transmission as SARS CoV
A saline gargle SG has proven to be an efficient method of sampling to detect SARS CoV The aim of this pilot study was to verify the efficiency of SG sampling in detecting the Omicron variant of SARS CoV Subjects were a total of patients with COVID Omicron variant and pairs of samples were collected A conventional oropharyngeal swab OPS was obtained and SG sampling was performed immediately afterward both were subjected to RT qPCR A subgroup analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was performed Results revealed no significant differences in the distribution of patients and cycle threshold CT values between the SG and OPS in overall data and data on days and The subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences between the SG and OPS results in symptomatic patients In asymptomatic patients the CT values for the SG were significantly lower than those for the OPS implying that SG sampling had better sensitivity in the context of the Omicron variant These data indicate that the SG had satisfactory efficiency vs the OPS An SG is a simple and less invasive method of sampling that is suited to mass frequent and repeated sampling to detect SARS CoV
Chlorine dioxide ClO sub sub is a high level disinfectant that is safe and widely used for sterilization Due to the limitations on preparing a stable solution direct use of ClO sub sub in the human body is limited Nasal irrigation is an alternative therapy used to treat respiratory infectious diseases This study briefly summarizes the available evidence regarding the safety efficacy of directly using ClO sub sub on the human body as well as the approach of nasal irrigation to treat COVID Based on the available information as well as a preliminary experiment that comprehensively evaluated the efficacy and safety of ClO sub sub ppm was deemed to be an appropriate concentration of ClO sub sub for nasal irrigation to treat COVID This finding requires further verification Nasal irrigation with ClO sub sub can be considered as a potential alternative therapy to treat respiratory infectious diseases and COVID in particular

The SARS CoV pandemic has posed a challenge for correctional facilities worldwide People in such settings are more vulnerable to severe forms of infection and it is impossible to completely isolate inmates from the outside world This study aimed to assess the antibody mediated immune response in terms of neutralizing antibodies against Alpha Beta Gamma and Omicron sub lineage BA variants of concern after two doses of mRNA vaccine in correctional officers and inmates from an Italian correctional facility Most of the correctional officers and inmates and retained their neutralizing activity toward the Alpha and Gamma variants respectively By contrast the most striking reduction in comparison with the ancestral virus was found in the antibody response toward the Beta and Omicron variants in both correctional officers and and inmates and In addition subjects who had undergone primary vaccination and had previously been naturally infected had higher neutralizing antibody titers toward the variants than negative subjects Overall our findings indicate that primary mRNA vaccination is able to induce neutralizing antibodies toward the ancestral virus while titers toward variants may vary depending on the mutations harboring by the variants Although the correctional setting is often considered distinct or isolated from the wider society and sanitary system the health of correctional workers and prisoners is inexorably linked to the public health of the country as a whole and it is of paramount importance to monitor the antibody response in these settings
The two proteases PL sup pro sup and M sup pro sup of SARS CoV are essential for replication of the virus Using a structure based co pharmacophore screening approach we developed a novel dual targeted inhibitor that is equally potent in inhibiting PL sup pro sup and M sup pro sup of SARS CoV The inhibitor contains a novel warhead which can form a covalent bond with the catalytic cysteine residue of either enzyme The maximum rate of the covalent inactivation is comparable to that of the most potent inhibitors reported for the viral proteases and covalent inhibitor drugs currently in clinical use The covalent inhibition appears to be very specific for the viral proteases The inhibitor has a potent antiviral activity against SARS CoV and is also well tolerated by mice and rats in toxicity studies These results suggest that the inhibitor is a promising lead for development of drugs for treatment of COVID

At the onset of the COVID pandemic protocols for community based management of acute malnutrition CMAM were implemented to support continuity of essential feeding services while mitigating COVID transmission To assess correlations between adaptation timing and CMAM program indicators we evaluated routine program data in Uganda Ethiopia and Somalia for children months of age We specifically analyzed facility level changes in total admissions average length of stay ALOS total children screened for admission and recovery rates before and after adaptations We found no statistically significant changes in program indicators after adaptations For Somalia we also analyzed child level changes in ALOS and in weight and mid upper arm circumference at admission and discharge ALOS significantly increased immediately after adaptations and then decreased to preadaptation levels We found no meaningful changes in either weight or mid upper arm circumference at admission or discharge These findings indicate that adapted CMAM programs can remain effective
The US President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief PEPFAR supports molecular HIV and tuberculosis diagnostic networks and information management systems in low and middle income countries We describe how national programs leveraged these PEPFAR supported laboratory resources for SARS CoV testing during the COVID pandemic We sent a spreadsheet template consisting of indicators for assessing the use of PEPFAR supported diagnostic networks for COVID pandemic response activities during April to March to PEPFAR supported countries or regions A total of PEPFAR supported centralized HIV viral load and early infant diagnosis laboratories and decentralized HIV and TB sites reported performing SARS CoV testing in countries Together these sites contributed to million SARS CoV tests during the year period Our findings illustrate that PEPFAR supported diagnostic networks provided a wide range of resources to respond to emergency COVID diagnostic testing in low and middle income countries
To determine early COVID burden in Malawi we conducted a multistage cluster survey in districts During October December we recruited community members median age years interquartile range years and health facility staff HFS median age years interquartile range years Real time PCR confirmed SARS CoV infection prevalence was CI among community and CI among HFS participants seroprevalence was CI among community and CI among HFS participants Most seropositive community and HFS participants were asymptomatic Seroprevalence was higher among urban community vs and HFS vs than among rural community participants Cumulative infection findings fold higher from this survey than national statistics vs and predominantly asymptomatic infections highlight a need to identify alternative surveillance approaches and predictors of severe disease to inform national response
Early warning and response surveillance EWARS systems were widely used during the early COVID response Evaluating the effectiveness of EWARS systems is critical to ensuring global health security We describe the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC global COVID EWARS CDC EWARS system and the resources CDC used to gather manage and analyze publicly available data during the prepandemic period We evaluated data quality and validity by measuring reporting completeness and compared these with data from Johns Hopkins University the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and indicator based data from the World Health Organization CDC EWARS was integral in guiding CDC s early COVID response but was labor intensive and became less informative as case level data decreased and the pandemic evolved However CDC EWARS data were similar to those reported by other organizations confirming the validity of each system and suggesting collaboration could improve EWARS systems during future pandemics
Viral genomic surveillance has been a critical source of information during the COVID pandemic but publicly available data can be sparse concentrated in wealthy countries and often made public weeks or months after collection We used publicly available viral genomic surveillance data submitted to GISAID and GenBank to examine sequencing coverage and lag time to submission during We compared publicly submitted sequences by country with reported infection rates and population and also examined data based on country level World Bank income status and World Health Organization region We found that as global capacity for viral genomic surveillance increased international disparities in sequencing capacity and timeliness persisted along economic lines Our analysis suggests that increasing viral genomic surveillance coverage worldwide and decreasing turnaround times could improve timely availability of sequencing data to inform public health action
Ghana is a yellow fever endemic country and experienced a vaccine derived polio outbreak in July A reactive polio vaccination campaign was conducted in September and preventive yellow fever campaign in November On March Ghana confirmed its first COVID cases During February August Ghana received COVID vaccines through the COVID Vaccines Global Access initiative and other donor agencies We describe how systems and infrastructure used for polio and yellow fever vaccine deployment and the lessons learned in those campaigns were used to deploy COVID vaccines During March August a total of vaccine doses were administered in Ghana By using existing vaccination and health systems officials in Ghana were able to deploy COVID vaccines within a few months with vaccine wastage and minimal additional resources despite the short shelf life of vaccines received These strategies were essential in saving lives in a resource limited country
Global emergence of the COVID pandemic in curtailed vaccine preventable disease VPD surveillance activities but little is known about which surveillance components were most affected In May we surveyed STOP originally Stop Transmission of Polio Program consultants to determine how VPD surveillance activities were affected by the COVID pandemic throughout primarily in low and middle income countries where program consultants are deployed Our report highlights the responses from of the consultants deployed to the World Health Organization African Region which comprises of all STOP Program consultants deployed globally in early Most survey respondents observed that VPD surveillance activities were somewhat or severely affected by the COVID pandemic in Reprioritization of surveillance staff and changes in health seeking behaviors were factors commonly perceived to decrease VPD surveillance activities Our findings suggest the need for strategies to restore VPD surveillance to prepandemic levels
The rapid rollout of vaccines against COVID as a key mitigation strategy to end the global pandemic might be informed by lessons learned from rubella vaccine implementation in response to the global rubella epidemic of That rubella epidemic led to the development of a rubella vaccine that has been introduced in all but countries worldwide and has led to elimination of rubella in countries Although widespread introduction and use of rubella vaccines was slower than that for COVID vaccines the process can provide valuable insights for the continued battle against COVID Experiences from the rubella disease control program highlight the critical and evolving elements of a vaccination program including clearly delineated goals and strategies regular data driven revisions to the program based on disease and vaccine safety surveillance and evaluations to identify the vaccine most capable of achieving disease control targets

Dry mature pericarp of i Citrus reticulata i Chachi PCR Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae Chachiensis is a traditional Chinese medicine that displays characteristics of different usage at different harvest times in clinical use The corresponding changes in the bioactive components in PCR from different harvest times remain unclear Therefore in this study broadly targeted metabolomics technology was used to compare the differences in bioactive components among pericarps of PCR which are the raw material of PCR at different growth stages In the results kinds of flavonoid metabolites were detected The content of hesperidin in red PCR harvested in December was higher than that in Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium Viride CRPV and reddish PCR harvested from July to November Furthermore the content of nobiletin tangeretin and heptamethoxyflavone in CRPV from July to September was higher than that in the PCR harvested at other times In addition the result of cluster analysis and PCA showed that CRPV harvested from July to September had an obvious grouping pattern with the reddish PCR and the red PCR harvested from October to December Differential metabolites in six comparison groups A vs A A vs A A vs A A vs A A vs A A vs A were and respectively The common differential metabolite of four comparison groups was trihydroxyflavone A vs A A vs A A vs A A vs A All the flavonoid differential metabolites screened were enriched in metabolic pathways Moreover the results of the evaluation of the total antioxidant capacity indicated that CRPV in August was a suitable raw material for the production of antioxidants Through molecular docking the content of potential anti SARS CoV components in the PCR in October was higher than that in the PCR in other periods These results further proved that PCR at different harvest times was endowed with different efficacy and usage due to the difference in the accumulation of bioactive components
Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are recognized as common symptoms in patients with COVID with a prevalence ranging respectively between and This review focused on relating the variations in dietary habits with the reduction loss of smell and or taste in patients who contracted the COVID infection Primarily we reviewed the main pathological mechanisms involved in COVID induced anosmia dysosmia and ageusia dysgeusia Then we explored and summarized the behavioural changes in food intake and body weight during the COVID pandemic in relation to sensory impairment and the underlying mechanisms Most studies on this topic argue that the altered chemosensory perception taste and smell mainly induces reduced appetite leading to a faster fullness sensation during the consumption of a meal and therefore to a decrease in body weight On the other hand a reduced perception of the food s sensory properties may trigger compensatory responses that lead some individuals to increase food intake with a different effect on body weight Regarding body weight most studies evaluated malnutrition in patients hospitalized for COVID more studies are warranted to investigate nutritional status specifically in non hospitalized patients with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions caused by COVID infection

triazoles are versatile building blocks with growing interest in medicinal chemistry For this reason organic chemistry focuses on the development of new synthetic pathways to obtain triazole derivatives especially with pyridine moieties In this work a novel series of disubstituted triazoles functionalized with pyrimidine nucleobases were prepared via dipolar cycloaddition reaction in a regioselective manner for the first time The i N i propargyl nucleobases used as an alkyne intermediate were obtained in high yields with a new two step procedure that selectively led to the monoalkylated compounds Then FeCl sub sub was employed as an efficient Lewis acid catalyst for dipolar cycloaddition between different aryl and benzyl azides and the i N i propargyl nucleobases previously synthesized This new protocol allows the synthesis of a series of new triazole derivatives with good to excellent yields The ADME Absorption Distribution Metabolism and Excretion analysis showed good pharmacokinetic properties and no violations of Lipinsky s rules suggesting an appropriate drug likeness for these new compounds Molecular docking simulations conducted on different targets revealed that two of these new hybrids could be potential ligands for viral and bacterial protein receptors such as human norovirus capsid protein SARS CoV NSP helicase and metallo β lactamase
Humanity has suffered from the coronavirus disease COVID pandemic over the past two years which has left behind millions of deaths Azithromycin AZ an antibiotic used for the treatment of several bacterial infections has shown antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV as well as against the dengue Zika Ebola and influenza viruses Additionally AZ has shown beneficial effects in non infective diseases such as cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis However the systemic use of AZ in several diseases showed low efficacy and potential cardiac toxicity The application of nanotechnology to formulate a lung delivery system of AZ could prove to be one of the solutions to overcome these drawbacks Therefore we aimed to evaluate the attenuation of acute lung injury in mice via the local delivery of an AZ nanoformulation The hot emulsification ultrasonication method was used to prepare nanostructured lipid carrier of AZ AZ NLC pulmonary delivery systems The developed formulation was evaluated and characterized in vitro and in vivo The efficacy of the prepared formulation was tested in the bleomycin BLM mice model for acute lung injury AZ NLC was given by the intratracheal IT route for days at a dose of about one eighth oral dose of AZ suspension Samples of lung tissues were taken at the end of the experiment for immunological and histological assessments AZ NLC showed an average particle size of nm polydispersity index of zeta potential of mV and a sustained release pattern after the initial drug release within the first h BLM successfully induced a marked increase in pro inflammatory markers and also induced histological changes in pulmonary tissues All these alterations were significantly reversed by the concomitant administration of AZ NLC IT Pulmonary delivery of AZ NLC offered delivery of the drug locally to lung tissues Its attenuation of lung tissue inflammation and histological injury induced by bleomycin was likely through the downregulation of the p gene and the modulation of Bcl expression This novel strategy could eventually improve the effectiveness and diminish the adverse drug reactions of AZ Lung delivery could be a promising treatment for acute lung injury regardless of its cause However further work is needed to explore the stability of the formulation its pharmacokinetics and its safety
The ever expanding pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV infection has gained attention as COVID and caused an emergency in public health to an unmatched level to date However the treatments used are the only options currently no effective and licensed medications are available to combat disease transmission necessitating further research In the present study an in silico based virtual screening of anti HIV bioactive compounds from medicinal plants was carried out through molecular docking against the main protease M sup pro sup PDB LU of SARS CoV which is a key enzyme responsible for virus replication A total of anti HIV compounds were found to have a binding affinity greater than kcal mol out of compounds screened Pseudohypericin had a high affinity with the energy of kcal mol demonstrating amino acid residual interactions with LEU GLU ARG and GLN followed by Hypericin kcal mol Moreover the ADME Absorption Distribution Metabolism and Excretion analysis of Pseudohypericin and Hypericin recorded a low bioavailability BA score of and violated Lipinski s rule of drug likeness The docking and molecular simulations indicated that the quinone compound Pseudohypericin could be tested in vitro and in vivo as potent molecules against COVID disease prior to clinical trials This was also supported by the theoretical and computational studies conducted The global and local descriptors which are the underpinnings of Conceptual Density FunctionalTheory CDFT have beenpredicted through successful model chemistry hoping that they could be of help in the comprehension of the chemical reactivity properties of the molecular systems considered in this study
Coronavirus Disease COVID is a highly contagious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus SARS CoV The World Health Organization WHO classified the disease a as global public health hazard on March Currently there are no adequate measures to combat viral infections including COVID and the medication guidelines for the management of COVID are dependent on previous findings from SARS CoV and MERS CoV research Natural products have achieved widespread acceptance around the world as a means of enhancing healthcare and disease prevention Plants are a potential source of antiviral factors such as flavonoids phenolic acids terpenoids and others Some of these agents exhibit a broad spectrum of antiviral activity This study aimed to screen herbal leads for possible inhibitors of the SARS CoV ADP Ribose Phosphatase enzyme ARP Guggulsterone was found to be highly stabilized within the active site of the viral ARP enzyme by molecular dynamic simulation with very little fluctuation throughout the simulation timeframe of ns Thus guggulsterone can be further used to develop a safe and competent medication for evolving therapy against SARS CoV in post preclinical and clinical trials
It is well known that vital enzymes in the replication process of the coronavirus are the SARS CoV PLpro and SARS CoV CLpro both of which are important targets in the search for anti coronavirus agents These two enzymes are responsible for cleavage at various polyprotein sites in the SARS CoV lifecycle Herein the dynamics of the polyprotein cleavage sequences for the boundary between non structural proteins Nsp and Nsp CS and between Nsp and Nsp CS in complex with both the papain like protein PLpro and the main protease CLpro were explored using computational methods The post dynamics analysis reveals that CS and CS both have greater stability when complexed with PLpro Of these two greater stability is observed for the CS PLpro complex while destabilization resulting in loss of CS from the PLpro active site is observed for CS PLpro suggesting the rate of exchange by the papain like protease is faster for CS compared to CS On the other hand the CLpro main protease also reveals stability for CS suggesting that the main protease could also play a potential role in the cleavage at point CS However destabilization occurs early in the simulation for the complex CLpro CS suggesting a poor interaction and non plausible protease cleavage of the polyprotein at CS by the main protease These findings could be used as a guide in the development and design of potent COVID antiviral inhibitors that mimic the CS cleavage site
COVID is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV a novel highly contagious and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late SARS CoV spreads primarily through virus containing droplets and small particles of air pollution which greatly increases the risk of inhaling these virus particles when people are in close proximity COVID is spreading across the world and the COVID pandemic poses a threat to human health and public safety To date there are no specific vaccines or effective drugs against SARS CoV In this review we focus on the enzyme targets of the virus and host that may be critical for the discovery of chemical compounds and natural products as antiviral drugs and describe the development of potential antiviral drugs in the preclinical and clinical stages At the same time we summarize novel emerging technologies applied to the research on new drug development and the pathological mechanisms of COVID
The COVID pandemic exposed the lack of antiviral agents available for human use while the complexity of the physiological changes caused by coronavirus SARS CoV imposed the prescription of multidrug pharmacotherapy to treat infected patients In a significant number of cases it was necessary to add antibiotics to the prescription to decrease the risk of co infections preventing the worsening of the patient s condition However the precautionary use of antibiotics corroborated to increase bacterial resistance Since the development of vaccines for COVID the pandemic scenario has changed but the development of new antiviral drugs is still a major challenge Research for new drugs with synergistic activity against virus and resistant bacteria can produce drug leads to be used in the treatment of mild cases of COVID and to fight other viruses and new viral diseases Following the repurposing approach plant spices have been searched for antiviral lead compounds since the toxic effects of plants that are traditionally consumed are already known speeding up the drug discovery process The need for effective drugs in the context of viral diseases is discussed in this review with special focus on plant based spices with antiviral and antibiotic activity The activity of plants against resistant bacteria the diversity of the components present in plant extracts and the synergistic interaction of these metabolites and industrialized antibiotics are discussed with the aim of contributing to the development of antiviral and antibiotic drugs A literature search was performed in electronic databases such as Science Direct SciELO Scientific Electronic Library Online LILACS Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences Elsevier SpringerLink and Google Scholar using the descriptors antiviral plants antibacterial plants coronavirus treatment morbidities and COVID bacterial resistance resistant antibiotics hospital acquired infections spices of plant origin coronaviruses and foods spices with antiviral effect drug prescriptions and COVID and plant synergism Articles published in English in the period from to and relevant to the topic were used as the main inclusion criteria

The COVID pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV has captivated the globe s attention since its emergence in This highly infectious spreadable and dangerous pathogen has caused health social and economic crises Therefore a worldwide collaborative effort was made to find an efficient strategy to overcome and develop vaccines The new vaccines provide an effective immune response that safeguards the community from the virus severity WHO has approved nine vaccines for emergency use based on safety and efficacy data collected from various conducted clinical trials Herein we review the safety and effectiveness of the WHO approved COVID vaccines and associated immune responses and their impact on improving the public s health Several immunological studies have demonstrated that vaccination dramatically enhances the immune response and reduces the likelihood of future infections in previously infected individuals However the type of vaccination and individual health status can significantly affect immune responses Exposure of healthy individuals to adenovirus vectors or mRNA vaccines causes the early production of antibodies from B and T cells On the other hand unhealthy individuals were more likely to experience harmful events due to relapses in their existing conditions Taken together aligning with the proper vaccination to a patient s case can result in better outcomes
Hematological and hemorheological parameters are known to be altered in COVID however the value of combined monitoring in order to deduce disease severity is only scarcely examined A total of acute SARS CoV infected patients aCOV and age matched healthy controls Con were included Blood of aCOV was sampled at admission T and at day T day T day T and day T while blood of Con was only sampled once Inter and intra group differences were calculated for hematological and hemorheological parameters Except for mean cellular volume and mean cellular hemoglobin all blood cell parameters were significantly different between aCOV and Con During the acute disease state T T hematological and hemorheological parameters were highly altered in aCOV in particular anemic conditions and increased immune cell response inflammation oxidative nitrosative stress decreased deformability as well as increased aggregation were observed During treatment and convalescence until T almost all abnormal values of aCOV improved towards Con values During the acute state of the COVID disease the hematological as well as the hemorheological system show fast and potentially pathological changes that might contribute to the progression of the disease but changes appear to be largely reversible after four weeks Measuring RBC deformability and aggregation as well as oxidative stress induction may be helpful in monitoring critically ill COVID patients
The life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus includes several steps that are supposedly mediated by liquid liquid phase separation LLPS of the viral nucleocapsid protein N and genomic RNA To facilitate the rational design of LLPS targeting therapeutics we modeled N RNA biomolecular condensates in vitro and analyzed their sensitivity to several small molecule antivirals The model condensates were obtained and visualized under physiological conditions using an optimized RNA sequence enriched with N binding motifs The antivirals were selected based on their presumed ability to compete with RNA for specific N sites or interfere with non specific pi pi cation pi interactions The set of antivirals included fleximers norcarbocyclic nucleoside analogs and perylene harboring nucleoside analogs as well as non nucleoside amphiphilic and hydrophobic perylene derivatives Most of these antivirals enhanced the formation of N RNA condensates Hydrophobic perylene derivatives and norcarbocyclic derivatives caused up to fold and fold enhancement respectively Molecular modeling data argue that hydrophobic compounds do not hamper specific N RNA interactions and may promote non specific ones These findings shed light on the determinants of potent small molecule modulators of viral LLPS
COVID was officially declared a global pandemic disease on March with severe implications for healthcare systems economic activity and human life worldwide Fast and sensitive amplification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS CoV nucleic acids is critical for controlling the spread of this disease Here a real time reverse transcription recombinase aided amplification RT RAA assay targeting conserved positions in the nucleocapsid protein gene i N i gene of SARS CoV was successfully established for SARS CoV The assay was specific to SARS CoV and there was no cross reaction with other important viruses The sensitivity of the real time RT RAA assay was copies per reaction at probability Furthermore concordance between the real time RT RAA and RT qPCR assays was achieved after testing clinical specimens Further linear regression analysis indicated a significant correlation between the real time RT RAA and RT qPCR assays with an R value of i p i lt In addition the amplicons of the real time RT RAA assay could be directly visualized by a portable blue light instrument making it suitable for the rapid amplification of SARS CoV in resource limited settings Therefore the real time RT RAA method allows the specific sensitive simple rapid and reliable detection of SARS CoV
The BQ SARS CoV variant also known as Cerberus is one of the most recent Omicron descendant lineages Compared to its direct progenitor BA BQ has some additional spike mutations in some key antigenic sites which confer further immune escape ability over other circulating lineages In such a context here we perform a genome based survey aimed at obtaining a complete as possible nuance of this rapidly evolving Omicron subvariant Genetic data suggest that BQ represents an evolutionary blind background lacking the rapid diversification that is typical of a dangerous lineage Indeed the evolutionary rate of BQ is very similar to that of BA sup sup and sup sup subs site year respectively which has been circulating for several months The Bayesian Skyline Plot reconstruction indicates a low level of genetic variability suggesting that the peak was reached around September Concerning the affinity for ACE structure analyses also performed by comparing the properties of BQ and BA RBD indicate that the impact of the BQ mutations may be modest Likewise immunoinformatic analyses showed moderate differences between the BQ and BA potential B cell epitopes In conclusion genetic and structural analyses on SARS CoV BQ suggest no evidence of a particularly dangerous or high expansion capability Genome based monitoring must continue uninterrupted for a better understanding of its descendants and all other lineages
SARS CoV a positive strand RNA virus has caused devastating effects The standard method for COVID diagnosis is based on polymerase chain reaction PCR The method needs expensive reagents and equipment and well trained personnel and takes a few hours to be completed The search for faster solutions has led to the development of immunological assays based on antibodies that recognize the viral proteins that are faster and do not require any special equipment Here we explore an innovative analytical approach based on the sandwich oligonucleotide hybridization which can be adapted to several biosensing devices including thermal lateral flow and electrochemical devices as well as fluorescent microarrays Polypurine reverse Hoogsteen hairpins PPRHs oligonucleotides that form high affinity triplexes with the polypyrimidine target sequences are used for the efficient capture of the viral genome Then a second labeled oligonucleotide is used to detect the formation of a trimolecular complex in a similar way to antigen tests The reached limit of detection is around nM a few femtomoles without the use of any amplification steps The triplex enhanced nucleic acid detection assay TENADA can be readily adapted for the detection of any pathogen requiring only the knowledge of the pathogen genome sequence
A state of immunothrombosis has been reported in COVID Platelets actively participate in this process However little is known about the ability of SARS CoV virus proteins to induce platelet activity Platelet rich plasma PRP was incubated with spike full length protein and the RBD domain in independent assays We evaluated platelet activation through the expression of P selectin and activation of glicoprotein IIbIIIa GP IIbIIIa determined by flow cytometry and the ability of the proteins to induce platelet aggregation We determined concentrations of immunothrombotic biomarkers in PRP supernatant treated with the proteins We determined that the spike full length proteins and the RBD domain induced an increase in P selectin expression and GP IIbIIIa activation i p i lt We observed that the proteins did not induce platelet aggregation but favored a pro aggregating state that in response to minimal doses of collagen could re establish the process i p i lt On the other hand the viral proteins stimulated the release of interleukin interleukin P selectin and the soluble fraction of CD ligand sCD L molecules that favor an inflammatory state i p i lt These results indicate that the spike full length protein and its RBD domain can induce platelet activation favoring an inflammatory phenotype that might contribute to the development of an immunothrombotic state
Evidence from studies in the general population suggests an association between vitamin D insufficiency deficiency and COVID susceptibility and disease severity The present study was performed on third trimester pregnant women at the time of delivery Seventy nine women tested negative for SARS CoV From women testing positive were asymptomatic presented a mild form of the disease and experienced severe symptoms Serum OH vitamin D levels were measured on blood samples collected on admission Low vitamin D levels were detected in symptomatic but not asymptomatic COVID patients compared to healthy women i p i In addition pregnant women in the mild COVID group and in the severe group were vitamin D deficient i p i On the other hand lasso regression analysis showed that OH vitamin D deficiency is an independent predictor of severe COVID with an odds ratio OR of CI i p i These results show the relationship between vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women and the severity of COVID infection and support the recommendation to supplement with vitamin D to avoid worse COVID outcomes during pregnancy
Although the global pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV is still ongoing there are currently no specific and highly efficient drugs for COVID available particularly in severe cases Recent findings demonstrate that severe COVID disease that requires hospitalization is associated with the hyperactivation of CD sup sup and CD sup sup T cell subsets In this study we aimed to counteract this high inflammatory state by inducing T cell hyporesponsiveness in a SARS CoV specific manner using tolerogenic dendritic cells tolDC In vitro activated SARS CoV specific T cells were isolated and stimulated with SARS CoV peptide loaded monocyte derived tolDC or with SARS CoV peptide loaded conventional conv DC We demonstrate a significant decrease in the number of interferon IFN γ spot forming cells when SARS CoV specific T cells were stimulated with tolDC as compared to stimulation with convDC Importantly this IFN γ downmodulation in SARS CoV specific T cells was antigen specific since T cells retain their capacity to respond to an unrelated antigen and are not mediated by T cell deletion Altogether we have demonstrated that SARS CoV peptide pulsed tolDC induces SARS CoV specific T cell hyporesponsiveness in an antigen specific manner as compared to stimulation with SARS CoV specific convDC These observations underline the clinical potential of tolDC to correct the immunological imbalance in the critically ill
The ionic E nanochannel viroporin is the weak point of SARS CoV the virus responsible for the still threatening COVID since it is vital to the virus s budding and propagation Therefore targeting it to disable its functions ought to incapacitate or at least weaken the virus The ionic currents inside this channel could be affected and disturbed by direct physical attack via the actions of external fields The paper presents the first step towards the application of such methods in the fight against the current pandemic numerical simulations of external fields impact on ionic currents through viral channels These simulations based on the actual detailed physical nanostructure of ionic channels measured experimentally and reported in the literature show that external physical fields can diminish the channel s currents and that the lower the channel s selectivity the stronger the effect Simulations suggest that SARS CoV E viroporin is almost non selective which means that the whole virus ought to be highly vulnerable to the actions of external physical fields much more vulnerable than the much more selective human cell ionic channels If corroborated by experiment this observation may result in an innovative method of dealing with the recent pandemic caused by SARS CoV and other similar viruses
SARS CoV as a zoonotic virus has significantly affected daily life and social behavior since its outbreak in late The concerns over its transmission through different media directly or indirectly have evoked great attention about the survival of SARS CoV virions in the environment and its potential infection of other animals To evaluate the risk of infection by SARS CoV and to counteract the COVID disease extensive studies have been performed to understand SARS CoV biogenesis and its pathogenesis This review mainly focuses on the molecular architecture of SARS CoV its potential for infecting marine animals and the prospect of drug discovery using marine natural products to combat SARS CoV The main purposes of this review are to piece together progress in SARS CoV functional genomic studies and antiviral drug development and to raise our awareness of marine animal safety on exposure to SARS CoV
Vascular occlusions in patients with coronavirus diseases COVID have been frequently reported in severe outcomes mainly due to a dysregulation of neutrophils mediating neutrophil extracellular trap NET formation Lung specimens from patients with COVID have previously shown a dynamic morphology categorized into three types of pleomorphic occurrence based on histological findings in this study These vascular occlusions in lung specimens were also detected using native endogenous fluorescence or NEF in a label free method The three types of vascular occlusions exhibit morphology of DNA rich neutrophil elastase NE poor type I NE rich DNA poor type II and DNA and NE rich type III cohort of eleven patients with six males and five females Age and gender have been presented in this study as influencing variables linking the occurrence of several occlusions with pleomorphic contents within a patient specimen and amongst them This study reports the categorization of pleomorphic occlusions in patients with COVID and the detection of these occlusions in a label free method utilizing NEF
COVID a significant global health threat appears to be an immune related disease Failure of effective immune responses in initial stages of infection may contribute to development of cytokine storm and systemic inflammation with organ damage leading to poor clinical outcomes Disease severity and the emergence of new SARS CoV variants highlight the need for new preventative and therapeutic strategies to protect the immunocompromised population Available data indicate that these people may benefit from adoptive transfer of allogeneic SARS CoV specific T cells isolated from convalescent individuals This review first provides an insight into the mechanism of cytokine storm development as it is directly related to the exhaustion of T cell population essential for viral clearance and long term antiviral immunity Next we describe virus specific T lymphocytes as a promising and efficient approach for the treatment and prevention of severe COVID Furthermore other potential cell based therapies including natural killer cells regulatory T cells and mesenchymal stem cells are mentioned Additionally we discuss fast and effective ways of producing clinical grade antigen specific T cells which can be cryopreserved and serve as an effective off the shelf approach for rapid treatment of SARS CoV infection in case of sudden patient deterioration
Coronavirus disease COVID is an infectious disease caused by SARS CoV Elderly people people with immunodeficiency autoimmune and malignant diseases as well as people with chronic diseases have a higher risk of developing more severe forms of the disease Pregnant women and children can becomesick although more often they are only the carriers of the virus Recent studies have indicated that infants can also be infected by SARS CoV and develop a severe form of the disease with a fatal outcome Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS ina pregnant woman can affect the supply of oxygen to the fetus and initiate the mechanism of metabolic disorders of the fetus and newborn caused by asphyxia The initial metabolic response of the newborn to the lack of oxygen in the tissues is the activation of anaerobic glycolysis in the tissues and an increase in the concentration of lactate and ketones Lipid peroxidation especially in nerve cells is catalyzed by iron released from hemoglobin transferrin and ferritin whose release is induced by tissue acidosis and free oxygen radicals Ferroptosis inducing factors can directly or indirectly affect glutathione peroxidase through various pathways resulting in a decrease in the antioxidant capacity and accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species ROS in the cells ultimately leading to oxidative cell stress and finally death Conclusion damage to the mitochondria as a result of lipid peroxidation caused by the COVID disease can cause the death of a newborn and pregnant women as well as short time and long time sequelae
Patients with cancer are more susceptible to a higher risk of coronavirus infection and its severe complications than the general population In addition these patients were not included in the pivotal clinical trials for COVID vaccines Therefore considerable uncertainty remains regarding the management of cancer patients during the COVID pandemic and the safety of COVID vaccinations in cancer patients In this review we summarize the current knowledge generated from the beginning of the COVID pandemic on the vulnerability of cancer patients to the coronavirus disease as well as the effectiveness of COVID vaccines in this population We also discuss the available data on the effects of anticancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors on the immune responses to SARS CoV in cancer patients Special attention in this review will be given to patients with lung cancer as such patients are at an increased risk for severe effects from COVID
At present there is a lack of clinical evidence about the impact and long term durability of the immune response induced by the third dose of mRNA vaccines In this study we followed up the B cell compartment behavior in a cohort of immunocompetent individuals three and six months after the third dose of vaccine During this period some subjects contracted the virus In uninfected vaccinated subjects we did not report any changes in serum spike specific IgG levels with a significant reduction in IgA Instead subjects recovered from natural infection showed a significant increase in both specific IgG and IgA Moreover we showed a time related decrease in IgG neutralizing potential to all SARS CoV variants of concern VOC in uninfected compared to recovered subjects who displayed an increased neutralizing ability particularly against the omicron variant Finally we underlined the presence of a pool of SARS CoV specific B cells in both groups that are prone to respond to restimulation as demonstrated by their ability to differentiate into plasma cells and to produce anti SARS CoV specific immunoglobulins These data lead us to assert the long term effectiveness of the BNT b vaccine in contrasting the severe form of the pathology and prevent COVID associated hospitalization
Interstitial lung diseases ILD are relatively rare and sometimes become life threatening In particular rapidly progressive ILD which frequently presents as acute lung injury ALI on lung histopathology shows poor prognosis if proper and immediate treatments are not initiated These devastating conditions include acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis AE IPF clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis CADM epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor EGFR TKI induced lung injury and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV infection named coronavirus disease COVID In this review clinical information physical findings laboratory examinations and findings on lung high resolution computed tomography and lung histopathology are presented focusing on majorly damaged cells in each disease Furthermore treatments that should be immediately initiated in clinical practice for each disease are illustrated to save patients with these diseases
We investigated specific humoral and T cell responses in people living with HIV PLWH before T after two T and after six months T from the third dose of the BNT b vaccine Healthy donors HD were enrolled The specific humoral response was present in most PLWH already after the second dose but the third dose increased both the rate of response and its magnitude Collectively no significant differences were found in the percentage of responding T cells between PLWH and HD At T stratifying PLWH according to CD cell count a lower percentage of responding T cells in lt cells µL subgroup compared to gt cells µL one was observed At T this parameter was comparable between the two subgroups and the same result was found at T However the pattern of co expression of IFNγ IL and TNFα in PLWH was characterized by a higher expression of TNFα independently of CD cell count indicating a persistent immunological signature despite successful ART mRNA vaccination elicited a specific response in most PLWH although the cellular one seems qualitatively inferior compared to HD Therefore an understanding of the T cell quality dynamic is needed to determine the best vaccination strategy and in general the capability of immune response in ART treated PLWH
The human coronavirus SARS CoV or COVID that emerged in late causes a respiratory tract infection and has currently resulted in more than million confirmed cases and over million deaths worldwide up to October The highest death rate caused by COVID is in older people especially those with comorbidities This evidence presents a challenge for biomedical research on aging and also identifies some key players in inflammation including mast cells and platelets which could represent important markers and at the same time unconventional therapeutic targets Studies have shown a decrease in the diversity of gut microbiota composition in the elderly particularly a reduced abundance of butyrate producing species and COVID patients manifest faecal microbiome alterations with an increase in opportunistic pathogens and a depletion of commensal beneficial microorganisms The main purpose of this narrative review is to highlight how an altered condition of the gut microbiota especially in the elderly could be an important factor and have a strong impact in the lung homeostasis and COVID phenomenon jointly to the activation of mast cells and platelets and also affect the outcomes of the pathology Therefore a targeted and careful control of the intestinal microbiota could represent a complementary intervention to be implemented for the management and the challenge against COVID
To explore the mechanistic origin that determines the binding affinity of SARS CoV spike receptor binding domain RBD to human angiotensin converting enzyme ACE we constructed the homology models of RBD ACE complexes of four Omicron subvariants BA BA BA and BA and compared them with wild type complex RBD sub WT sub ACE in terms of various structural dynamic properties by molecular dynamics MD simulations and binding free energy BFE calculations The results of MD simulations suggest that the RBDs of all the Omicron subvariants RBD sub OMI sub s feature increased global structural fluctuations when compared with RBD sub WT sub Detailed comparison of BFE components reveals that the enhanced electrostatic attractive interactions are the main determinant of the higher ACE binding affinity of RBD sub OMI sub s than RBD sub WT sub while the weakened electrostatic attractive interactions determine RBD of BA subvariant RBD sub BA sub lowest ACE binding affinity among all Omicron subvariants The per residue BFE decompositions and the hydrogen bond HB networks analyses indicate that the enhanced electrostatic attractive interactions are mainly through gain loss of the positively negatively charged residues and the formation or destruction of the interfacial HBs and salt bridges can also largely affect the ACE binding affinity of RBD It is worth pointing out that since Q R plays the most important positive contribution in enhancing binding affinity the absence of this mutation in RBD sub BA sub results in a significantly weaker binding affinity to ACE than other Omicron subvariants Our results provide insight into the role of electrostatic interactions in determining of the binding affinity of SARS CoV RBD to human ACE
The current global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV of COVID has infected hundreds of millions of people killed millions and continues to pose a threat It has become one of the largest epidemics in human history causing enormous damage to people s lives and economies in the whole world However there are still many uncertainties and continued attention to the impact of SARS CoV on human health The entry of SARS CoV into host cells is facilitated by the binding of the spike protein on the virus surface to the cell surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme ACE Furthermore transmembrane protease serine TMPRSS is a host surface protease that cleaves and proteolytically activates its S protein which is necessary for viral infection Thus SARS CoV uses the ACE receptor for cell entry and initiates the S protein using the protease TMPRSS i Schizophyllum commune i SC is one of the most widely distributed fungi often found on the rotten wood of trees that has been found to have various health benefits including anticancer antimicrobial activity antiparasitic and immunomodulatory function In this article SC significantly diminished the expression ACE and TMPRSS protein in vitro and in vivo without cell damage In addition adenosine from SC was also proven in this experiment to reduce the ACE and TMPRSS expression Thus our findings suggest that SC and adenosine exhibit potential for the repression of SARS CoV infection via the ACE and TMPRSS axis
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV is the causative agent of the pandemic that broke out in and continues to be the cause of massive global upheaval Coronaviruses are positive strand RNA viruses with a genome of kb The genome is replicated and transcribed by RNA dependent RNA polymerase together with accessory factors One of the latter is the protein helicase NSP which is essential for viral replication The recently solved helicase structure revealed a tertiary structure composed of five domains Here we investigated NSP from a structural point of view comparing its RNA free form with the RNA engaged form by using atomistic molecular dynamics MD simulations at the microsecond timescale Structural analyses revealed conformational changes that provide insights into the contribution of the different domains identifying the residues responsible for domain domain interactions in both observed forms The RNA free system appears to be more flexible than the RNA engaged form This result underlies the stabilizing role of the nucleic acid and the functional core role of these domains
Predicting SARS CoV mutations is difficult but predicting recurrent mutations driven by the host such as those caused by host deaminases is feasible We used machine learning to predict which positions from the SARS CoV genome will hold a recurrent mutation and which mutations will be the most recurrent We used data from April that we separated into three sets a training set a validation set and an independent test set For the test set we obtained a specificity value of a sensitivity value of and an Area Under the Curve AUC of showing that the prediction of recurrent SARS CoV mutations is feasible Subsequently we compared our predictions with updated data from January showing that some of the false positives in our prediction model become true positives later on The most important variables detected by the model s Shapley Additive exPlanation SHAP are the nucleotide that mutates and RNA reactivity This is consistent with the SARS CoV mutational bias pattern and the preference of some host deaminases for specific sequences and RNA secondary structures We extend our investigation by analyzing the mutations from the variants of concern Alpha Beta Delta Gamma and Omicron Finally we analyzed amino acid changes by looking at the predicted recurrent mutations in the M pro and spike proteins
Findings collected over two and a half years of the COVID pandemic demonstrated that the level immunity resulting from vaccination and infection is insufficient to stop the circulation of new genetic variants The short term decline in morbidity was followed by a steady increase The early identification of new genetic lineages that will require vaccine adaptation in the future is an important research target In this study we summarised data on the variability of genetic line composition throughout the COVID pandemic in Moscow Russia and evaluated the virological and epidemiological features of dominant variants in the context of selected vaccine prophylaxes The prevalence of the Omicron variant highlighted the low effectiveness of the existing immune layer in preventing infection which points to the necessity of optimising the antigens used in vaccines in Moscow Logistic growth curves showing the rate at which the new variant displaces the previously dominant variants may serve as early indicators for selecting candidates for updated vaccines along with estimates of efficacy reduced viral neutralising activity against the new strains and viral load in previously vaccinated patients
The changes occurring in viral quasispecies populations during infection have been monitored using diversity indices nucleotide diversity and several other indices to summarize the quasispecies structure in a single value In this study we present a method to partition quasispecies haplotypes into four fractions according to their fitness the master haplotype rare haplotypes at two levels those present at lt and those at and a fourth fraction that we term i emerging haplotypes i present at frequencies gt but less than that of the master haplotype We propose that by determining the changes occurring in the volume of the four quasispecies fitness fractions together with those of the Hill number profile we will be able to visualize and analyze the molecular changes in the composition of a quasispecies with time To develop this concept we used three data sets a technical clone of the complete SARS CoV spike gene a subset of data previously used in a study of rare haplotypes and data from a clinical follow up study of a patient chronically infected with HEV and treated with ribavirin The viral response to ribavirin mutagenic treatment was selection of a rich set of synonymous haplotypes The mutation spectrum was very complex at the nucleotide level but at the protein phenotypic functional level the pattern differed showing a highly prevalent master phenotype We discuss the putative implications of this observation in relation to mutagenic antiviral treatment
The outbreaks caused by RNA and DNA viruses such as SARS CoV and monkeypox pose serious threats to human health The RLR and cGAS STING pathways contain major cytoplasmic sensors and signaling transduction axes for host innate antiviral immunity In physiological and virus induced pathological states the activation and inactivation of these signal axes are tightly controlled especially post translational modifications PTMs E ubiquitin ligases E s are the direct manipulator of ubiquitin codons and determine the type and modification type of substrate proteins Therefore members of the E s family are involved in balancing the host s innate antiviral immune responses and their functions have been extensively studied over recent decades In this study we overviewed the mechanisms of different members of three E s families that mediate the RLR and cGAS STING axes and analyzed them as potential molecular targets for the prevention and treatment of virus related diseases
This review outlines the data of numerous studies relating to the broad spectrum antiviral drug Triazavirin that was launched on the Russian pharmaceutical market in as an anti influenza drug the international non patented name is Riamilovir The range of antiviral activity of Triazavirin has been significantly expanded during recent years in particular it has been shown that Triazavirin exhibits activity against tick borne encephalitis Rift Valley fever West Nile fever and other infections of viral etiology This drug has been approved for treatment of influenza and acute respiratory infections by the Russian Ministry of Health on the basis of comprehensive clinical trials involving over patients Triazavirin was found to be a highly effective and well tolerated drug allowing its over the counter sale The recently published data on the use of Triazavirin in clinical practice for the treatment of patients with COVID are discussed with special attention paid to potential biological targets for this drug
Coronavirus SARS CoV has represented and still represents a real challenge from a clinical diagnostic and therapeutic point of view During acute infection the increased levels of pro inflammatory cytokines which are involved in the pathology of disease and the development of SARS CoV induced acute respiratory disease syndrome the life threatening form of this infection are correlated with patient survival and disease severity IL a key cytokine involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses in mucosal organs can increase airway inflammation mucus secretion and Th cytokine synthesis in the lungs following respiratory infections Similar to cases of exposure to known respiratory virus infections exposure to SARS CoV induces the expression of IL correlating with T cell activation and lung disease severity In this work we analyse current evidence regarding the immunological role of IL in patients affected by COVID to evaluate not only the clinical impact correlated to its production but also to identify possible future immunological therapies that can block the most expressed inflammatory molecules preventing worsening of the disease and saving patient lives
Inflammasome activation is one of the first steps in initiating innate immune responses In this work we studied the activation of inflammasomes in the airways of critically ill COVID patients and the effects of N acetylcysteine NAC on inflammasomes Tracheal biopsies were obtained from critically ill patients without COVID and no respiratory disease control i n i SARS CoV B variant i n i and B VOC alpha variant i n i patients Gene expression and protein expression were measured by RT qPCR and immunohistochemistry Macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells were stimulated with different S E M and N SARS CoV recombinant proteins in the presence or absence of NAC NLRP inflammasome complex was over expressed and activated in the COVID B VOC variant and associated with systemic inflammation and day mortality TLR MyD and redox NOX Nrf ratio were also over expressed in the COVID B VOC variant The combination of S E M SARS CoV recombinant proteins increased cytokine release in macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells through the activation of TLR NAC inhibited SARS CoV mosaic S E M induced cytokine release and inflammasome activation In summary inflammasome is over activated in severe COVID and increased in B VOC variant In addition NAC can reduce inflammasome activation induced by SARS CoV in vitro which may be of potential translational value in COVID patients
The impact of COVID on pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease PIBD is still not clear and the knowledge acquired over the last years is still evolving This study aims to investigate the risk and clinical outcomes of COVID in patients with PIBD A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted to identify studies published up until September Out of the articles screened studies were included in the review Of the children with PIBD included tested positive for COVID Among those with COVID needed hospitalization were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit PICU and no deaths were reported Among the included studies only four presented details regarding patients symptoms with presenting gastrointestinal GI symptoms An association between PIBD activity or specific treatment and COVID outcome could not be established The prevalence of COVID in patients with PIBD was low therefore the initial concerns regarding higher infection risk and worse prognosis in this population are not supported by the currently available data Further research is needed to determine the natural history of the infection and the optimal treatment for these patients Much is still unclear and additional studies should be performed in order to optimize prevention and care for this special group of patients
The modulation of the pharmacological action of drugs due to drug drug interactions DDIs is a critical issue in healthcare The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and the clinical significance of potential DDIs in patients admitted to the University Hospital of Heraklion in Greece with coronavirus disease COVID Cardiovascular disorders and diabetes types I and II were the most common comorbidities A high occurrence of DDIs was observed and clinically significant DDIs that may hamper response to treatment represented of cases on admission during hospitalization and upon discharge Polypharmacy and comorbidities were associated with a higher prevalence of DDIs in a statistically significant way i p i lt CI Clinically significant DDIs and increased C reactive protein values upon admission were associated with prolonged hospitalization The results reveal that patients admitted due to COVID in Greece often have an additional burden of DDIs that healthcare teams should approach and resolve

Background The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the pandemic on transfer rates of severely injured patients within the German TraumaNetzwerk of the DGU Furthermore cause of accident rescue times and trauma cases are compared to pre pandemic times Methods For this investigation patients documented in the TraumaRegister DGU sup sup from to were analyzed The years and served as a comparison to the first COVID pandemic year All primary admissions and transfers were included if treated on an intensive care unit Results Demographics age sex and injury severity in were comparable with In a significant decrease in car accidents was found In contrast a significant increase in bicycle accidents was seen During the second wave there was a significant burden of COVID patients on hospitals In this time we found a significant increase in early transfers of trauma patients primarily from small level to large level centers There was also a small but significant increase in rescue time especially during the nd wave Conclusions Our data confirm the importance of the network structures established in the TraumaNetzwerk DGU sup sup especially during the pandemic The established structures allow smaller hospitals to spread their resources and prevent internal collapse Therefore the structures of the TraumaNetzwerk DGU sup sup play a prominent role in stabilizing the healthcare system by helping to maintain both surgical and critical care capacity and providing adequate emergency care
Background The SARS CoV pandemic had a significant impact on the management of traumatic brain injury TBI We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of TBI patients before and during the SARS CoV pandemic Methods We analyzed depicted data from existing medical records on sex age mechanism of injury clinical performance at admission and discharge neuroimaging laboratory values at admission mortality duration of hospitalization and referrals after discharge from the traumatology department for all adult patients during the SARS CoV pandemic and a year before Variables were compared using the Chi square or t test between both groups Results Most patients had mild n followed by moderate and severe TBI Mild TBI was less frequent during the SARS CoV period n vs n The incidence of high falls increased during the SARS CoV period vs i p i lt in the group with mild TBI Patients had similar mean Glasgow Coma Scales GCS Glasgow Outcome Scales Extended GOSE and glucose levels at admission before and during the pandemic Serum ethanol levels were significantly lower during the SARS CoV period mmol L vs mmol L i p i lt At discharge the mean GCS was significantly lower vs i p i lt for patients treated during the SARS CoV period than before the SARS CoV period There were no differences in GOSE Conclusions our results demonstrated a significant impact of SARS CoV pandemic on the frequency mechanism and consequences of TBI and may help improve care for our patients
The COVID pandemic has caused extended global disruption and changed healthcare behaviour and delivery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease many of whom take immune modifying treatment Although there were fears about the vulnerability of IBD patients to SARS CoV infection we have learnt that overall IBD patients are equivalent to the general population in both viral acquisition and infection outcomes Overall IBD patients obtain effective vaccine induced immune responses although in some groups an additional vaccine dose is required to constitute a primary course The pandemic has led to significant changes in healthcare delivery some of which will be enduring As we grapple with the challenges of recovery the lessons learnt will continue to be important in optimising outcomes in future outbreaks
The coronavirus disease of COVID has been a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide Among the short and long term consequences of COVID myocarditis is a disease to be taken into consideration Myocarditis in general is related to a poor prognosis However the epidemiology and prognosis of myocarditis related to COVID are currently unknown While vaccination against COVID is of great benefit at a public health level the risk of myocarditis should be considered in the context of the global benefits of vaccination In this narrative review we will summarize the etiopathogenic bases the epidemiology the clinical manifestations the course diagnosis prognosis and the treatment of myocarditis related to SARS CoV as well as myocarditis secondary to mRNA vaccines
Since December the world has experienced a pandemic caused by SARS CoV a virus which spread throughout the world Anti COVID measures were applied to limit the spread of the infection affecting normal clinical practice In studies on the possible impact of the pandemic considering the screening programs for early diagnosis of cancer were conducted resulting in a prediction of delayed diagnosis of cancer We performed a retrospective monocentric study on patients who present with the onset of lymphadenomegalies evaluated at our Hematological Department from February to October and undergoing excisional lymph node biopsy Three periods were considered pre pandemic first pandemic period and second pandemic period Group A B and C We included patients who underwent a surgical biopsy and received a histological diagnosis Hematological evaluation of outpatients sent by the general practitioner and surgical biopsies did not decrease among the three groups despite limitations placed during this pandemic as well as new diagnoses of hematological malignancies However the diagnosis of metastatic cancer significantly increased from to i p i Our data supports the hypothesis that the pandemic affected the national screening programs of early cancer detection
Despite in vitro activity of interferon β IFN β against SARS CoV infection its clinical efficacy remains controversial We evaluated the impact of IFN β treatment in a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID during March April The primary endpoint was a composed variable of admission to intensive care unit ICU death Overall patients received IFN β They were significantly more severely ill with a worse clinical and analytical situation explaining a higher ICU admission vs i p lt i and a shorter time to the composed variable In a Cox regression analysis older age lymphopenia renal failure or increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were associated with a greater hazard ratio HR of admission at ICU death Notably the HR of IFN β for the outcome variable was no longer significant after adjustment HR CI and different sensitivity analysis early IFN use ICU admission showed no changes in the estimates A propensity score matching analysis showed no association of IFN β therapy and outcome In conclusion in this large cohort of hospitalized COVID patients IFN β was used mainly in patients with advanced disease reflecting an important bias of selection After adjusting by severity IFN β was not associated with a higher rate of ICU admission or mortality

Marine microplastic pollution MMP is becoming one of the most pressing environmental problems facing humanity today The novel coronavirus epidemic has raised the issue of environmental contamination caused by large scale improper disposal of medical waste such as disposable masks DMs To assess the impact of MMP caused by DMs and to seek solutions for the prevention and control of MMP this study uses the Driving force Pressure State Impact Response DPSIR framework to establish a causal chain of MMP caused by DMs The conclusion shows that the novel coronavirus epidemic has led to a surge in the use of DMs which has brought pressure on resource constraints and environmental pollution at the same time Improperly DMs enter the environment and eventually transform into MMP which not only endangers the marine ecological system but also poses potential human health risks as well as economic and social hazards In addition further research on environmentally friendly masks cloth masks and biodegradable masks is essential to mitigate the environmental damage caused by the large scale global use of DMs This study provides a scientific and theoretical basis for the assessment of MMP from discarded DMs and the findings of this study will provide a reference for the formulation of relevant policies
The worldwide pandemic has exposed healthcare professionals to a high risk of infection exacerbating the situation of uncertainty caused by COVID The objective of this review was to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID pandemic on dental professionals and their patients A literature review was conducted using Medline Pubmed Web of Science and Scopus databases excluding systematic reviews narratives meta analyses case reports book chapters short communications and congress papers A modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale NOS was used to evaluate the quality of the selected studies The search retrieved articles and of these were selected for the review longitudinal and cross sectional studies Elevated anxiety levels were observed in dental professionals especially in younger and female professionals Except for orthodontic treatments patients reported a high level of fear that reduced their demand for dentist treatment to emergency cases alone The results suggest that the COVID pandemic has had psychological and emotional consequences for dental professionals and their patients Further research is necessary to evaluate the persistence of this problem over time
The widespread outbreak of the COVID virus had substantial impacts on higher education which turned into distance using virtual environments and electronic e learning platforms There is a growing body of research on the effect of COVID on students education and e learning experiences amid the pandemic However limited research was performed to assess the learning experience before and amid the COVID pandemic among students in specific disciplines such as accounting The current research compares accounting students learning experience and satisfaction before and amid the COVID pandemic We distributed a pre tested questionnaire online to students through our colleagues The results of the SEM multi group analysis with Amos indicated significant differences between students experience before and amid the COVID pandemic which had a significant influence on their satisfaction Accounting students were found to have more participation in learning to receive proper support and motivation and to have better assessment and feedback before than amid COVID However they had better access to information and learning resources and were able to construct knowledge amid the pandemic using e learning than before the pandemic Several implications from the findings are raised and discussed
Social isolation and school closure may predispose adolescents to higher prevalence rates of depression anxiety and stress In this cross sectional observational study the validated Spanish version of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale was administered to students aged years old We also collected data on participant gender age group school shift morning or afternoon school year family type whether they or any first degree relative had been infected with COVID whether any family member had died of COVID and whether either of their parents worked Mean scores were for depression for anxiety and for stress Female students presented significantly higher scores on all three measures compared with male students Students who had been infected with COVID who had an infected family member or who had a family member who died of COVID also presented higher scores on all three measures Identifying the symptoms and warning signs of depression and anxiety disorders is critical particularly in vulnerable populations like adolescents
The prevalence of reported mental health problems among university students has increased at alarming rates in recent years While various negative life events from personal events such as relationship breakdowns to more global events such as COVID SARS CoV pandemic have been found to be important predictors of poor mental health in this population some individuals have been found robustly to fare better than others in confronting such events Identifying factors that predict these individuals mental health along with the specific coping strategies they utilize may have significant practical implications when confronted by adverse events such as COVID This study investigated relationships between the impact of the COVID pandemic on females males and one Other Chinese university students mental health and their internal strengths personality characteristics and demographic profiles We also investigated whether students use of specific coping strategies mediated these relationships Stepwise multiple regression analyses MRAs and a path analysis revealed that students who resided in their home country had higher levels of internal strengths a lower level of neuroticism and a higher level of agreeableness and reported fewer negative mental health changes than did other respondents during COVID in the second half of Self regulation and withdrawal coping strategies were both important mediators of these relationships These findings have important implications for universities in identifying and assisting students in the face of adverse events such as COVID
Coronavirus disease COVID led to the loss of lives and had serious social and economic effects Countries implemented various quarantine policies to reduce the effects The countries were divided into low and high risk groups based on the differences in quarantine policies and their levels of infection Quarantine policies that significantly contributed to risk reduction were determined by analyzing quarantine indicators for reducing the spread of COVID The cross tabulation and Chi square tests were used to compare the quarantine policies by the groups Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the useful quarantine policies implemented by the low risk group to verify quarantine policies for minimizing the negative effects The analysis showed that the low and medium risk groups showed significant differences for of the indicators and of these differentiated the low from the medium risk group Countries with strict quarantine policies related to workplace closure and staying at home were more likely to be included in the low risk group These policies had a significant impact in the low risk countries and could contribute to reducing the spread and effects of COVID in countries included in the high risk group
In building areas with high occupancy such as classrooms transmission routes of SARS CoV are increased when indoor air quality is deficient Under this scenario universities have adopted ventilation measures to mitigate contagious environments However the lack of adequate equipment or designs in old educational buildings is a barrier to reach minimum requirements This study aims to quantify the indoor air quality and thermal comfort at universities and compare it to conditions in students households In this regard several classrooms in buildings of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia were monitored for temperature CO sub sub concentration and relative humidity The people who used these classrooms were surveyed about their comfort perceptions A sample of students was also monitored at their homes where they reported to studying during the exam period By means of point in time surveys students reported their daily comfort for comparison with the monitored data The results show that the recommendations for CO sub sub concentration temperature and relative humidity are not always met in any of the study spaces These factors are more critical at universities due to the high occupancy In addition the surveys highlighted the perception that the environment is better at home than at university
Although many studies of long COVID were reported there was a lack of systematic research which assessed the differences of long COVID in regard to what unique SARS CoV strains caused it As such this systematic review and meta analysis aims to evaluate the characteristics of long COVID that is caused by different SARS CoV strains We systematically searched the PubMed EMBASE and ScienceDirect databases in order to find cohort studies of long COVID as defined by the WHO Geneva Switzerland The main outcomes were in determining the percentages of long COVID among patients who were infected with different SARS CoV strains Further this study was registered in PROSPERO CRD A total of studies with patients was included of which three studies possessed the Alpha and Delta variants and five studies possessed the Omicron variant The highest pooled estimate of long COVID was found in the CT abnormalities CI for the wild type strain fatigue CI for the Alpha variant and general symptoms CI for the Omicron variant The pooled estimates of general symptoms CI and fatigue were the highest symptoms found among patients infected with the Alpha variant followed by the wild type strain and then the Omicron variant The pooled estimate of myalgia was highest among patients infected with the Omicron variant compared with those infected with the wild type strain The pooled estimate of sleep difficulty was lowest among the patients infected with the Delta variant when compared with those infected with the wild type strain and the Omicron variant The findings of this study suggest that there is no significant difference between long COVID that has been caused by different strains except in certain general symptoms i e in the Alpha or Omicron variant and in sleep difficulty i e the wild type strain In the context of the ongoing COVID pandemic and its emerging variants directing more attention to long COVID that is caused by unique strains as well as implementing targeted intervention measures to address it are vital
Social media networks highly influence on a broad range of global social life especially in the context of a pandemic We developed a mathematical model with a computational tool called EMIT Epidemic and Media Impact Tool to detect and control pandemic waves using mainly topics of relevance on social media networks and pandemic spread Using EMIT we analyzed health related communications on social media networks for early prediction detection and control of an outbreak EMIT is an artificial intelligence based tool supporting health communication and policy makers decisions Thus EMIT based on historical data social media trends and disease spread offers an predictive estimation of the influence of public health interventions such as social media based communication campaigns We have validated the EMIT mathematical model on real world data combining COVID pandemic data in the US and social media data from Twitter EMIT demonstrated a high level of performance in predicting the next epidemiological wave AUC i F i sub sub
The increasing number of people living with Long COVID requires the development of more personalized care currently limited treatment options and rehabilitation programs adapted to the variety of Long COVID presentations are available Our objective was to design an easy to use Long COVID classification to help stratify people with Long COVID Individual characteristics and a detailed set of self reported persisting symptoms together with quality of life indexes months after initial COVID infection were collected in a cohort of SARS CoV infected people in Luxembourg A hierarchical ascendant classification HAC was used to identify clusters of people We identified three patterns of Long COVID symptoms with a gradient in disease severity Cluster Mild encompassed almost of the study population and was composed of participants with less severe initial infection fewer comorbidities and fewer persisting symptoms mean Cluster Moderate was characterized by a mean of persisting symptoms and poor sleep and respiratory quality of life Compared to the other clusters Cluster Severe was characterized by a higher proportion of women and smokers with a higher number of Long COVID symptoms in particular vascular urinary and skin symptoms Our study evidenced that Long COVID can be stratified into three subcategories in terms of severity If replicated in other populations this simple classification will help clinicians improve the care of people with Long COVID

Throughout the pandemic national and international health authorities have called on the population to collaborate and contribute with their behavior to control the problem The aim of this study is to analyze the implementation of the protective measures against COVID and to determine the factors involved in their compliance To respond to the objectives a cross sectional study was performed involving a total of individuals An ad hoc online questionnaire was created and shared through social networks scientific societies and various health institutions The probability of high or total compliance with the protective measures was higher in women OR and as age increases with an OR in the interval between and years old and an OR in the oldest interval and over This study shows the characteristics of the population that considers it more likely to be infected by SARS CoV thus adopting greater adherence to prevention measures Knowing which factors are associated with adherence to protective measures is essential for establishing effective pandemic control measures Our findings may be useful for designing future awareness campaigns adapted to different socio demographic characteristics in settings affected by COVID
The aim of this study is to review the currently available data and to explore the association of infection with different severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV variants during pregnancy with maternal and perinatal outcomes in the real world Observational cohort studies were analyzed that described the maternal and perinatal outcomes of infection with different SARS CoV variants during pregnancy Random effects inverse variance models were used to evaluate the pooled prevalence PP and its confidence interval CI for maternal and perinatal outcomes Random effects were used to estimate the pooled odds ratios OR and their CI for different outcomes between Delta and pre Delta periods and between Omicron and Delta periods Eighteen studies involving a total of cases of SARS CoV infection during pregnancy cases of SARS CoV wild type or pre variant infection and cases of SARS CoV variant infections were included in this meta analysis Among pregnant women with SARS CoV infections the PPs for required respiratory support severe or critical illness intensive care unit ICU admission maternal death and preterm birth lt weeks were respectively CI CI CI CI and CI in the Delta period which were higher than those in the pre Delta period while the corresponding PPs were respectively CI CI CI CI and CI The PPs for required respiratory support severe or critical illness and ICU admission were respectively CI CI and CI in the Omicron period which were lower than those in the pre Delta and Delta periods These results suggest that Omicron infections are associated with less severe maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes though maternal ICU admission the need for respiratory support and preterm birth did also occur with Omicron infections Since Omicron is currently the predominant strain globally and has the highest rates of transmission it is still important to remain vigilant in protecting the vulnerable populations of mothers and infants In particular obstetricians and gynecologists should not ignore the adverse risks of maternal ICU admission respiratory support and preterm births in pregnant patients with SARS CoV infections in order to protect the health of mothers and infants
Timely access to essential health services is a concern as COVID continues This study aimed to investigate health services utilization during the first wave of the pandemic in China A cross sectional online survey was conducted using a self administrated questionnaire in March Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for data analysis A total of respondents were included with reporting affected services utilization Clinical testing and drug purchase were the most affected types Higher education level being married chronic disease frequently visiting a provincial medical institution spending more time on pandemic related information perception of high risk of infection perception of large health impact of the pandemic and anxiety depression were significant predictors for reporting affected services utilization For the chronic disease respondents reported interruption especially for drug purchase Affected health services utilization was reported during the first wave of the pandemic in China especially for those with higher education level chronic diseases and COVID related concerns Enhancing primary healthcare use of telehealth extended prescription and public communication were countermeasures undertaken by China during the rapid rise period As COVID progresses the changing disease characteristics adapted health system along with enhanced public awareness knowledge should be considered for the evolution of health services utilization and further investigation is needed
Amyloid protein cross seeding is a peculiar phenomenon of cross spreading among different diseases Unlike traditional infectious ones diseases caused by amyloid protein cross seeding are spread by misfolded proteins instead of pathogens As a consequence of the interactions among misfolded heterologous proteins or polypeptides amyloid protein cross seeding is considered to be the crucial cause of overlapping pathological transmission between various protein misfolding disorders PMDs in multiple tissues and cells Here we briefly review the phenomenon of cross seeding among amyloid proteins As an interesting example worth mentioning the potential links between the novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID and some neurodegenerative diseases might be related to the amyloid protein cross seeding thus may cause an undesirable trend in the incidence of PMDs around the world We then summarize the theoretical models as well as the experimental techniques for studying amyloid protein cross seeding Finally we conclude with an outlook on the challenges and opportunities for basic research in this field Cross seeding of amyloid opens up a new perspective in our understanding of the process of amyloidogenesis which is crucial for the development of new treatments for diseases It is therefore valuable but still challenging to explore the cross seeding system of amyloid protein as well as to reveal the structural basis and the intricate processes
The coronavirus disease COVID has caused the most recent global economic collapse which severely impacted worldwide economic operations Natural resource volatility significantly affects global economic recovery Therefore the study aims to determine the significance of natural resource volatility foreign trade technological innovation urbanisation and investment in energy resources on the economic recovery of Chinese provinces A total of provinces in China were examined between and The generalised method of movement GMM technique was used to demonstrate that investments in energy sector resources international commerce and technological innovation are inconsistent than gross domestic product GDP and natural resources The results demonstrated how trade blocs limit the effect of natural resources on regional economic development in the central provinces Specifically of energy was saved while of emissions were reduced Although abundant natural resources significantly influence economic growth studies discovered a negative impact on urbanisation Nonetheless the positive effects of trade openness outweighed those of economic recovery The study proposed stabilising the fluctuating costs of natural resources encouraging green financing and increasing investment in energy resources The findings also provided a novel strategy for achieving high economic growth and recovery
Road crashes are a major problem for traffic safety management which usually causes flash crowd traffic with a profound influence on traffic management and communication systems In the sudden outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID pandemic led to significant changes in road traffic conditions In this paper by analyzing crash data from to and new COVID case data in we find that the average crash severity and crash deaths during this period a rapid increase of new COVID cases in are higher than those in previous four years Hence it is necessary to exploit a novel road crash risk prediction model for such an emergency We propose a novel data adaptive fatigue focal loss DA FFL method by fusing fatigue factors to establish a road crash risk prediction model under the scenario of large scale emergencies Finally the experimental results demonstrate that DA FFL performs better than the other typical methods in terms of area under curve AUC and false alarm rate FAR for imbalanced data Furthermore DA FFL has better prediction performance in convolutional neural networks long short term memory CNN LSTM
Almost one third of all infectious diseases are caused by viruses and these diseases account for nearly of all deaths globally It is becoming increasingly clear that highly contagious viral infections pose a significant threat to global health and economy around the world The need for innovative affordable and safe antiviral therapies is a must Zinc oxide nanoparticles are novel materials of low toxicity and low cost and are known for their antiviral activity The genus Pelargonium was previously reported for its antiviral and antimicrobial activity In this work i Pelargonium zonale i leaf extract chemical profile was studied via high performance liquid chromatography HPLC and was used for the biosynthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles Furthermore the antiviral activity of the combination of i P zonale i extract and the biosynthesized nanoparticles of ZnO against the human corona E virus was investigated Results revealed that ZnONPs had been biosynthesized with an average particle size of about nm and characterized with UV FTIR TEM XRD and SEM The antiviral activity showed significant activity and differences among the tested samples in favor of the combination of i P zonale i extract and ZnONPs ZnONPs Ex The lowest IC sub sub µg mL and the highest SI of ZnONPs Ex assert the highest antiviral activity of the combination against human coronavirus E
PEDV represents an ancient Coronavirus still causing huge economic losses to the porcine breeding industry Resveratrol has excellent antiviral effects Triacetyl resveratrol TCRV a novel natural derivative of resveratrol has been recently discovered and its pharmacological effects need to be explored further This paper aims to explore the relationship between PEDV and TCRV which offers a novel strategy in the research of antivirals In our study Vero cells and IPEC J cells were used as an in vitro model First we proved that TCRV had an obvious anti PEDV effect and a strong inhibitory effect at different time points Then we explored the mechanism of inhibition of PEDV infection by TCRV Our results showed that TCRV could induce the early apoptosis of PEDV infected cells in contrast to PEDV induced apoptosis Moreover we observed that TCRV could promote the expression and activation of apoptosis related proteins and release mitochondrial cytochrome C into cytoplasm Based on these results we hypothesized that TCRV induced the early apoptosis of PEDV infected cells and inhibited PEDV infection by activating the mitochondria related caspase pathway Furthermore we used the inhibitors Z DEVD FMK and Pifithrin α PFT α to support our hypothesis In conclusion the TCRV activated caspase pathway triggered early apoptosis of PEDV infected cells thereby inhibiting PEDV infections
b Objectives b Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum are associated with high mortality in invasively ventilated coronavirus disease COVID patients however the mortality rates among non intubated patients remain unknown We aimed to analyze the clinical features of COVID associated pneumothorax pneumomediastinum in non intubated patients and identify risk factors for mortality b Methods b We searched PubMed Scopus and Embase from January to December We performed a pooled analysis of patients with no invasive mechanical ventilation history from case series and case reports Subsequently we developed a novel scoring system to predict in hospital mortality the system was further validated in multinational cohorts from ten countries i n i b Results b Clinical scenarios included pneumothorax pneumomediastinum at presentation i n i pneumothorax pneumomediastinum onset during hospitalization i n i and pneumothorax pneumomediastinum development after recent COVID treatment i n i Significant differences were not observed in clinical outcomes between patients with pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax pneumomediastinum The overall mortality rate of pneumothorax pneumomediastinum was Risk factor analysis revealed that comorbidities bilateral pneumothorax and fever at pneumothorax pneumomediastinum presentation were predictors for mortality In the new scoring system i e the CoBiF system the area under the curve which was used to assess the predictability of mortality was External validation results were also promising area under the curve b Conclusions b The presence of comorbidity bilateral pneumothorax and fever on presentation are significantly associated with poor prognosis in COVID patients with spontaneous pneumothorax pneumomediastinum The CoBiF score can predict mortality in clinical settings as well as simplify the identification and appropriate management of patients at high risk

Prior to deployment of COVID vaccines in the European Union EU in a high vaccine uptake leading to an unprecedented volume of safety data from spontaneous reports and real world evidence was anticipated The European Medicines Agency EMA implemented specific activities to ensure enhanced monitoring of emerging vaccine safety information including intensive monitoring of reports of adverse events of special interest AESIs and the use of observed to expected O E analyses EMA also commissioned several independent observational studies using a large network of electronic healthcare databases and primary data collection via mobile and web based applications This preparedness was key for two high profile safety signals thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome TTS a new clinical entity associated with adenovirus vectored vaccines and myocarditis pericarditis with messenger RNA mRNA vaccines With no existing case definition nor background rates the signal of TTS posed particular challenges Nevertheless it was rapidly identified evaluated contextualised and the risk minimised thanks to close surveillance and an efficient use of available evidence clinical expertise and flexible regulatory tools The two signals illustrated the complementarity between spontaneous and real world data the former enabling rapid risk identification and communication the latter enabling further characterisation The COVID pandemic has tremendously enhanced the development of tools and methods to harness the unprecedented volume of safety data generated for the vaccines Areas for further improvement include the need for better and harmonised data collection across Member States e g stratified vaccine exposure to support signal evaluation in all population groups risk contextualisation and safety communication
Inflammatory disease is often associated with an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism in affected patients although in most instances the mechanistic basis for this increased thrombogenicity remains poorly understood Acute infection as exemplified by sepsis malaria and most recently COVID drives immunothrombosis where the immune defence response to capture and neutralise invading pathogens causes concurrent activation of deleterious prothrombotic cellular and biological responses Moreover dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease allergies and neurodegenerative disorders are now recognised to occur in parallel with activation of coagulation In this review we describe the detailed cellular and biochemical mechanisms that cause inflammation driven haemostatic dysregulation including aberrant contact pathway activation increased tissue factor activity and release innate immune cell activation and programmed cell death and T cell mediated changes in thrombus resolution In addition we consider how lifestyle changes increasingly associated with modern life such as circadian rhythm disruption chronic stress and old age are increasingly implicated in unbalancing haemostasis Finally we describe the emergence of potential therapies with broad ranging immunothrombotic functions and how drug development in this area is challenged by our nascent understanding of the key molecular and cellular parameters that control the shared nodes of proinflammatory and procoagulant pathways Despite the increasing recognition and understanding of the prothrombotic nature of inflammatory disease significant challenges remain in effectively managing affected patients and new therapeutic approaches to curtail the key pathogenic steps in immune response driven thrombosis are urgently required
Inspired by the BMJ Global Health Editorial by Atkins i et al i on global health GH teaching during the COVID pandemic a group of GH students and recent graduates from around the world convened to discuss our experiences in GH education during multiple global crises Through weekly meetings over the course of several months we reflected on the impact the COVID pandemic and broader systemic inequities and injustices in GH education and practice have had on us over the past years Despite our geographical and disciplinary diversity our collective experience suggests that while the pandemic provided an opportunity for changing GH education that opportunity was not seized by most of our institutions In light of the mounting health crises that loom over our generation emerging GH professionals have a unique role in critiquing deconstructing and reconstructing GH education to better address the needs of our time By using our experiences learning GH during the pandemic as an entry point and by using this collective as an incubator for dialogue and re imagination we offer our insights outlining successes and barriers we have faced with GH and its education and training Furthermore we identify autonomous collectives as a potential viable alternative to encourage pluriversality of knowledge and action systems and to move beyond Western universalism that frames most of traditional academia
The topic of inequitable vaccine distribution has been widely discussed by academics journalists and policy makers in the context of the COVID pandemic However research into perceptions of vaccine equity has been particularly neglected resulting in a lack of universal understanding of vaccine equity To address this we conducted a meta narrative review on COVID vaccine equity according to the Realist And MEta narrative Evidence Syntheses Evolving Standards RAMESES publication standard The review included articles published between January and September It aims to identify research traditions that have considered this topic and investigate how it has been conceptualised explore any potential differences in understandings of the concept of vaccine equity adopted by distinct research groups and investigate the angles from which authors based their recommendations on how vaccine equity can be achieved Five meta narratives from the literature across various research traditions are identified contextualised and discussed frameworks and mechanisms for vaccine allocation global health law vaccine nationalism ethics and morality and reparative justice Our findings indicate the need for a comparative review of existing global COVID allocation frameworks with a focus on explicating understandings of vaccine equity COVID will not be the last health crisis the world confronts Heterogeneity in the academic literature is part of the way concepts are debated and legitimised but in the interests of global public health policy making it is desirable to reach a consensus on what constitutes progress on equitable development production distribution and research

Post COVID conditions also known as long COVID has significantly impacted the lives of many individuals but the risk factors for this condition are poorly understood In this study we performed a retrospective EHR analysis of individuals at a multi state health system in the United States with PCR confirmed COVID including patients diagnosed with long COVID and matched controls not diagnosed with long COVID For these two cohorts we evaluated a wide range of clinical covariates including laboratory tests medication orders phenotypes recorded in the clinical notes and outcomes We found that chronic pulmonary disease CPD was significantly more common as a pre existing condition for the long COVID cohort than the control cohort odds ratio CI Additionally long COVID patients were more likely to have a history of migraine odds ratio CI and fibromyalgia odds ratio CI During the acute infection phase the following lab measurements were abnormal in the long COVID cohort high triglycerides mean sub longCOVID sub mg dL vs mean sub control sub mg dL low HDL cholesterol levels mean sub longCOVID sub mg dL vs mean sub control sub mg dL and high neutrophil lymphocyte ratio mean sub longCOVID sub vs mean sub control sub The hospitalization rate during the acute infection phase was also higher in the long COVID cohort compared to the control cohort rate sub longCOVID sub vs rate sub control sub Overall this study suggests that the severity of acute infection and a history of CPD migraine CFS or fibromyalgia may be risk factors for long COVID symptoms Our findings motivate clinical studies to evaluate whether suppressing acute disease severity proactively especially in patients at high risk can reduce incidence of long COVID
Colleges and universities in the US struggled to provide safe in person education throughout the COVID pandemic Testing coupled with isolation is a nimble intervention strategy that can be tailored to mitigate health and economic costs as the virus and our arsenal of medical countermeasures continue to evolve We developed a decision support tool to aid in the design of university based testing strategies using a mathematical model of SARS CoV transmission Applying this framework to a large public university reopening in the fall of with a student vaccination rate we find that the optimal strategy in terms of health and economic costs is twice weekly antigen testing of all students This strategy provides a guarantee that throughout the fall semester case counts would not exceed the CDCâ s original high transmission threshold of cases per k persons over days As the virus and our medical armament continue to evolve testing will remain a flexible tool for managing risks and keeping campuses open We have implemented this model as an online tool to facilitate the design of testing strategies that adjust for COVID conditions university specific parameters and institutional goals
The spread of SARS CoV like that of many other pathogens is governed by heterogeneity Superspreading or over dispersion is an important factor in transmission yet it is hard to quantify Estimates from contact tracing data are prone to potential biases due to the increased likelihood of detecting large clusters of cases and may reflect variation in contact behavior more than biological heterogeneity In contrast the average number of secondary infections per contact is routinely estimated from household surveys and these studies can minimize biases by testing all members of a household However the models used to analyze household transmission data typically assume that infectiousness and susceptibility are the same for all individuals or vary only with predetermined traits such as age Here we develop and apply a combined forward simulation and inference method to quantify the degree of inter individual variation in both infectiousness and susceptibility from observations of the distribution of infections in household surveys First analyzing simulated data we show our method can reliably ascertain the presence type and amount of these heterogeneities with data from a sufficiently large sample of households We then analyze a collection of household studies of COVID from diverse settings around the world and find strong evidence for large heterogeneity in both the infectiousness and susceptibility of individuals Our results also provide a framework to improve the design of studies to evaluate household interventions in the presence of realistic heterogeneity between individuals

The editorial demonstrates changes in the number and subject matter of papers dealing with issues related to the coronavirus disease COVID which were published in Advances in Clinical and Experimental Medicine ACEM during years of the pandemic In such manuscripts were submitted to the editorial office of which were published in were submitted and published while in there were articles submitted and published Authors of this editorial point out that while initially chances for publication of papers regarding COVID were greater than papers covering other issues the editors of ACEM gradually enforced the same requirements for COVID related papers as for the others the acceptance rate for these papers was in in and in The published papers described among other aspects the relationship between COVID and other diseases e g pneumonia Parkinson s disease and acute kidney injury and methods of preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV infection among healthcare staff An emergency situation of pandemic called for disseminating the results of scientific research as promptly as possible however the proper answer to this challenge is not lowering and simplifying requirements for peer review but releasing the results in a form of registered preprints which allow for provisionally making the paper available for the scientific community while the peer review verification is still ongoing
Acute kidney injury occurs frequently in COVID patients infected by the coronavirus SARS CoV and infection of kidney cells by this virus has been reported However little is known about the direct impact of the SARS CoV infection upon the renal tubular cells We report that SARS CoV activated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription STAT signaling and caused cellular injury in the human renal tubular cell line HK Mechanistically the viral protein ORF A of SARS CoV augmented both NF κB and STAT signaling and increased the expression of kidney injury molecule KIM SARS CoV infection or expression of ORF A alone elevated the protein level of Tripartite motif containing protein TRIM a ubiquitin E ligase which interacts with both ORF A and STAT The excessive TRIM in turn dissociated the phosphatase TCPIP from binding to STAT and hence inhibited the dephosphorylation of STAT leading to persistent STAT activation Consistently ORF A induced renal injury in zebrafish and mice In addition expression of TRIM was elevated in the kidney autopsies of COVID patients with AKI Thus the aberrant activation of STAT signaling by TRIM plays a significant role in the renal tubular cell injury caused SARS CoV which suggest a potential targeted therapy for the renal complications of COVID
From April through at least the end of Americans died from non Covid causes at an average annual rate of in excess of previous trends Hypertension and heart disease deaths combined were elevated Diabetes or obesity drug induced causes and alcohol induced causes were each elevated to above previous upward trends Drug deaths especially followed an alarming trend only to significantly exceed it during the pandemic to reach for calendar year Homicide and motor vehicle fatalities combined were elevated almost Various other causes combined to add While Covid deaths overwhelmingly afflict senior citizens absolute numbers of non Covid excess deaths are similar for each of the to to and over age groups with essentially no aggregate excess deaths of children Mortality from all causes during the pandemic was elevated for working age adults as compared to for the elderly Other data on drug addictions non fatal shootings weight gain and cancer screenings point to a historic yet largely unacknowledged health emergency
To prevent the spread of COVID face masks were mandatory in many public spaces around the world Since faces are the gateway to early social cognition this raised major concerns about the effect face masks may have on infants attention to faces as well as on their language and social development The goal of the present study was to assess how face masks modulate infants attention to faces over the course of the first year of life We measured and month olds looking behavior using a paired visual preference paradigm under two experimental conditions First we tested infants preference for upright masked or unmasked faces of the same female individual We found that regardless of age infants looked equally long at the masked and unmasked faces Second we compared infants attention to an upright masked versus an inverted masked face Three and month olds looked equally long to the masked faces when they were upright or inverted However and month old infants showed a novelty preference for the inverted masked face Our findings suggest that more experience with faces including masked faces leads to efficient adaptations of infants visual system for processing impoverished social stimuli such as partially occluded faces
Epidemic wavefront models predict the spread of medieval pandemics such as the plague well Our aim was to explore whether they contribute to understanding the spread of COVID the first truly global pandemic of the st century with its fast and frequent international travel links
People who use drugs with life limiting illnesses experience substantial barriers to accessing palliative care Demand for palliative care is expected to increase during communicable disease epidemics and pandemics Understanding how epidemics and pandemics affect palliative care for people who use drugs is important from a service delivery perspective and for reducing population health inequities
Coronavirus disease COVID arrived in the New York metropolitan area in early March Recommendations were made to self quarantine within households and limit outside visits including those to clinics and hospitals to limit the spread of the virus This resulted in a decrease in pediatric emergency department ED visits However it is unclear how this affected visits for some common diagnoses such as anxiety appendicitis asthma headaches seizures and urinary tract infection UTI These diagnoses were chosen a priori as they were felt to represent visits to the ED for which the diagnoses would likely not be altered based on COVID exposure or quarantine due to their acute nature
The COVID pandemic and consequent public health response may have undermined key responses to the protracted drug poisoning crisis including reduced access to opioid agonist therapy OAT among people with opioid use disorder Our study objectives were to estimate the prevalence of and identify factors associated with inability to contact OAT prescribers when in need among people on OAT in a Canadian setting during the dual public health crises
Generated by the immune system post infection or through vaccination the effectiveness of antibodies against emerging SARS CoV variants is crucial for protecting individuals from the COVID pandemic Herein a platform for the multiplexed evaluation of SARS CoV neutralizing antibodies against various variants was designed on the basis of near infrared NIR surface enhanced fluorescence by nano plasmonic gold chip pGOLD Antibody level across variants Wild type Alpha Beta Delta Omicron was confirmed by the sera from recovered individuals who were unvaccinated and had infected with Wild type Delta Omicron variants However the neutralizing activity against Omicron variant was markedly decreased for individuals infected by Wild type fold and Delta variant fold To the opposite neutralizing antibody from individuals recovered from Omicron variant infection showed weak binding strength against non Omicron variants Antibody evolution over time was studied with individuals days post Wild type infection Decreasing IgG antibody titer accompanied by increasing IgG binding avidity with elongated post infection period were observed for the sera from Wild type recovered individuals with different post infection times suggesting that after the primary infection a great number of antibodies were generated and then gradually decreased while the antibody matured over time By comparing the IgG level of individuals vaccinated for days with individual post infection we found that ca month after two doses of vaccination the antibody level was comparable to that of days post infection and vaccination could enhance IgG avidity more efficiently This work demonstrated a platform for the multiplexed high throughput and rapid screening of acquired immunity against SARS CoV variants providing a new approach for the analysis of vaccine effectiveness immunity against emerging variants and related serological study
The application of single cell RNA sequencing in COVID research has greatly improved our understanding of COVID pathogenesis and immunological characteristics In this commentary we discuss the current challenges limitations and perspectives in harnessing the power of single cell RNA sequencing to accelerate both basic research and therapeutic development for COVID and other emerging infectious diseases
Thromboembolism was a chief cause of mortality in of patients with COVID Our objective was to see if serum interleukins beta IL β and soluble platelets selectin sP selectin could serve as novel markers of thromboembolism in COVID patients
The risk for symptomatic COVID requiring hospitalization is higher in the older population The course of the disease in hospitalised older patients may show significant variation from mild to severe illness ultimately leading to death in the most critical cases The analysis of circulating biomolecules involved in mechanisms of inflammation cell damage and innate immunity could lead to identify new biomarkers of COVID severity aimed to improve the clinical management of subjects at higher risk of severe outcomes In a cohort of COVID geriatric patients n who required hospitalization we analysed on admission a series of circulating biomarkers related to neutrophil activation neutrophil elastase LL macrophage activation sCD and cell damage nuclear cfDNA mithocondrial cfDNA and nuclear cfDNA integrity The above reported biomarkers were tested for their association with in hospital mortality and with clinical inflammatory and routine hematological parameters Aim of the study was to unravel prognostic parameters for risk stratification of COVID patients
The emergence of new variants of SARS CoV is continuously posing pressure to the epidemic prevention and control in China The Omicron variant of SARS CoV having stronger infectivity immune escape ability and capability causing repetitive infection spread to many countries and regions all over the world including South Africa United States and United Kingdom etc in a short time The outbreaks of Omicron variant also occurred in China The aim of this study is to understand the epidemiological characteristics of Omicron variant infection in Shenzhen and to provide scientific basis for effective disease control and prevention
Routinely collected health data from ambulatory care providers offer a wide range of research opportunities However the access is often e g technically hindered particularly in Germany In the following we describe the development of an infrastructure for the analysis of pseudonymized routine data extracted from primary care practices in Germany Further we analyze the impact of the outbreak of SARS CoV on the utilization of primary care services for patients with type diabetes mellitus DM type
Caring for patients with coronavirus disease COVID challenges nurses and causes them to experience stress and anxiety From this perspective it is of utmost importance to develop quick and effective intervention strategies to prevent numerous complications This study aimed to investigate the effect of the progressive muscle relaxation technique using the demonstration method on the stress and anxiety of nurses who care for COVID patients
COVID pandemic has had mixed reactions from nations people and governments about ways to cope with prevent and control the disease The current study identifies social cultural and policy factors affecting the incidence and control of Coronavirus disease in Iran
COVID presented an unprecedented global public health challenge because of its rapid and relentless spread and many countries instituted lockdowns to prevent the spread of infection Although this strategy may have been appropriate to reduce infection it presented unintended difficulties in rural Uganda especially in maternal and born newborn care For example some services were suspended meaning the nearest health facility was at a considerable distance This study explored the experiences of mothers and their significant others of comprehensive care in the first days of life post conception during the COVID pandemic in Bunghokho Mutoto sub county Mbale District Uganda
To improve the efficiency of clinical trials leveraging external data on control and or treatment effects which is almost always available appears to be a promising approach
In our Information Technology IT based societies social media play an important role in communications and social networks for COVID This study explores social responses for COVID in North America which the most severe continent affected by the COVID pandemic This study employs social network analysis for Twitter among the US Canada and Mexico This study finds that the three countries show different characteristics of social networks for COVID For example the Prime Minister plays the second important role in the Canada networks whereas the presidents play the most significant role in them in the US and Mexico WHO shows a pivotal effect on social networks of COVID in Canada and the US whereas it does not affect them in Mexico Canada people are interested in COVID apps the US people criticize the president and administration as incompetent for COVID and Mexico people search for COVID cases and the pandemic in Mexico This study shows that governments and disease experts should understand social networks and communications of social network services to develop effective COVID policies according to the characteristics of their country
Current global health course is most set as elective course taught in traditional teacher taught model with low credit and short term Innovate teaching models are required Crowdsourcing characterized by high flexibility and strong application orientation holds its potential to enhance global health education We applied crowdsourcing to global health teaching for undergraduates aiming to develop and evaluate a new teaching model for global health education
Clinical data on patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV delta variant are limited especially on clinical status after the application of antibody therapy
The risk of severe coronavirus disease COVID is increased in people with diabetes but effects of diabetes type and other risk factors remain incompletely characterized We studied this in a Swedish cohort of hospitalized patients with type and type diabetes T D and T D also including comparisons with influenza epidemics of recent years
Diagnostic testing for SARS CoV is critical to manage the pandemic and its different waves The requirement to pay out of pocket OOP for testing potentially represents both a financial barrier to access and for those who manage to make the payment a source of financial hardship as they may be forced to reduce spending on other necessities This study aims to assess age related inequality in affordability of COVID tests
